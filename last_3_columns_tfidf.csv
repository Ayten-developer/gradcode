Igive a name to this rule.I specify the word to Outlookso I can take it into account.I can add several eventualities.By clicking on the Plus, I canadd other words or expressions.Now we have to specifywhat Outlook has to do when itidentifies this word in the message.I want to mark thismessage in a category.I use the category Ihave created and click OK.I can display moreoptions and add more actions.We can go further whenwriting a rule, but that needsreflection beforestarting to make a rule.I can save it.

Add numbers,"You can use Excel to add numbers using formulas, buttons and functions. Let's take a look.You add numbers incells by using formulas.A formula alwaysstarts with the equal sign.Then enter a number, then a plus sign, then another number and press Enter andthe cell displays the results.You can add many numbersthis way, not just two.Instead of adding numberswithin a cell, you can alsoreference cells tomake adding a bit easier.B2 is equal to 6, B3 is equal to 3or create a formulathat adds the cells.I start with an equal sign,click the cell that I want to add, then a plus signand then another cell and press Enter. If I change a number in a cell, the results automatically update.You can also add manycells this way, not just two.You can even add cells and numbers.I start with equal sign,click the cell I want to add,then a plus sign, thenanother cell, then another plus sign, thenumber and press Enter.When you double-click acell, you can see if it has a number or a formula or you canlook up here in the formula bar.AutoSum makes it easy to addadjacent cells in rows and columns.Click the cell below acolumn of adjacent cells or to the right of a row of adjacent cells.Then on the Home tab,click AutoSum and press Enter. Excel adds all of thecells in the column or row.It's really handy.The keyboard shortcut for AutoSum is Alt-=.You can even select an adjacent group of cells and an extra column and row, click AutoSum and you get the sumfor each row andcolumn and a grand total.AutoSum has a number of options.Choose an option such as Average and Excel calculates the average for the row.To copy a cell and its formula, click the cell,point to the bottom right of the cell border so that you see a plus sign, hold down your left mouse button and drag it to the right for a column or down for a row and the formula is copied into the new cells.",use excel add number use formula button function let take lookyou add number incel use formulasa formula alwaysstart equal signthen enter number plu sign anoth number press enter andth cell display resultsy add mani numbersthi way twoinstead ad numberswithin cell alsorefer cell tomak ad bit easierb2 equal 6 b3 equal 3or creat formulathat add cellsi start equal signclick cell want add plu signand anoth cell press enter chang number cell result automat updatey also add manycel way twoyou even add cell numbersi start equal signclick cell want addthen plu sign thenanoth cell anoth plu sign thenumb press enterwhen doubleclick acel see number formula canlook formula barautosum make easi addadjac cell row columnsclick cell acolumn adjac cell right row adjac cellsthen home tabclick autosum press enter excel add thecel column rowit realli handyth keyboard shortcut autosum altyou even select adjac group cell extra column row click autosum get sumfor row andcolumn grand totalautosum number optionschoos option averag excel calcul averag rowto copi cell formula click cellpoint bottom right cell border see plu sign hold left mous button drag right column row formula copi new cell
The SUM function,"When I click inside anAutoSum value, we see it's a formula with the sum function. A function is a predefined formula, it helps you save time.Let me show you.This formula is =,SUM, open parenthesisB2:B5 and parenthesis. The colon indicates a range of cells.The formula adds the rangeof cells from B2 through B5,it's essentially B2+B3+B4+B5.You can see that when adding a few cells, the SUM fonction will save you time. With larger ranges of cells, it's essential.To create a formula with aSUM fonction, you type =, SUM, open parenthesis, selectthe range of cells you want to add, and press Enter.The syntax or grammar ofthe SUM function is SUM,open parenthesis, number 1, number 2and so on, and a closing parenthesis.The arguments of afunction, in this case, number 1, 2and so on, are always containedin opening and closing parentheses.Number 1 is required.Square brackets around subsequentarguments indicate they are optional.The arguments areseparated by commas.The arguments don't have toliterally be numbers such as 8.They can be numbers from arange of cells, formulas or the results from other functions.You can use up to atotal of 255 arguments.Let's try it out.If I try to use AutoSumhere, it only gets the adjacent cells, not the entire column.We can enter the sum function so that it adds the entire column, you do this byentering individual cells.I type =, SUM,open parenthesis, press theCtrl key so I don't have to type the commas, select the first cell, the next cell and so on, and finally press Enter.The formula uses the sumfunction to add the cells.As we previously saw, you can adda range of cells that are adjacent.To add ranges of cells thatare not adjacent, type the =,SUM, open parenthesis,hold down the Ctrl key,select the first range of cells,select the second rangeof cells and press Enter.Let's take a close look at the formula: as always it starts with =, then the SUM fonction, open parenthesis, then the first range of cells, D2:D3,this is the number 1argument in a SUM fonction, then a comma, then the nextrange of cells D5:D6,this is the number 2argument in a SUM fonction, and then the closing parenthesis. You can sum numbers from differentworksheets in the same workbook.I type the equalsign, sum, parenthesis,first cell, comma, select the second cell from a different worksheet, and press Enter.As always the formula startswith an equal sign, then the SUM fonction, open parenthesis, C8 is the number 1 argument inthe function, then a comma.In creating the formula, allyou have to do is select the cell in a differentworksheet, but I thought I'd gothrough what it looks likein a formula, it starts with an apostrophe, thename of the worksheet,another apostrophe, anexclamation point, and then the cell reference onthe other worksheet.Pretty cool.",click insid anautosum valu see formula sum function function predefin formula help save timelet show youthi formula sum open parenthesisb2b5 parenthesi colon indic rang cellsth formula add rangeof cell b2 b5it essenti b2b3b4b5you see ad cell sum fonction save time larger rang cell essentialto creat formula asum fonction type sum open parenthesi selectth rang cell want add press enterth syntax grammar ofth sum function sumopen parenthesi number 1 number 2and close parenthesisth argument afunct case number 1 2and alway containedin open close parenthesesnumb 1 requiredsquar bracket around subsequentargu indic optionalth argument aresepar commasth argument dont toliter number 8they number arang cell formula result functionsy use atot 255 argumentslet tri outif tri use autosumher get adjac cell entir columnw enter sum function add entir column byenter individu cellsi type sumopen parenthesi press thectrl key dont type comma select first cell next cell final press enterth formula use sumfunct add cellsa previous saw adda rang cell adjacentto add rang cell thatar adjac type sum open parenthesishold ctrl keyselect first rang cellsselect second rangeof cell press enterlet take close look formula alway start sum fonction open parenthesi first rang cell d2d3thi number 1argument sum fonction comma nextrang cell d5d6thi number 2argument sum fonction close parenthesi sum number differentworksheet workbooki type equalsign sum parenthesisfirst cell comma select second cell differ worksheet press entera alway formula startswith equal sign sum fonction open parenthesi c8 number 1 argument inth function commain creat formula allyou select cell differentworksheet thought id gothrough look likein formula start apostroph thenam worksheetanoth apostroph anexclam point cell refer onth worksheetpretti cool
The SUMIF function,"The SUMIF function allowsyou to add cells that meet a criteria that you provide. For example, in this formula, if B2 isgreater than 100, add C2,if B3 is greater than100, add C3 and so on.The syntax of the SUMIFfunction is SUMIF, open parenthesis, range, comma,criteria, comma, sum_range, close parenthesis. Range is the range of cells that you want to evaluate using the criteria such as B2 through B6. Criteria define what the cells in the range are evaluated against, such as greater than 100.Sum_range are theactual cells to add if the corresponding cells in therange match the criteria, such as C2 through C6. Brackets around sum_range indicate it's optional. If sum_range isn't used, the cells in the range are both evaluatedby the criteria and added if they match the criteria.Let's try it out.We're going to create aformula that adds property valuesthat are over $160,000.We start with an equal sign, SUMIF,open parentheses, select the range,comma, put the criteria in quotes, in this case greater than 160,000 and press Enter.And the sum of the property values over $160,000 is $900,000. This is an examplewhere sum_range is omitted.The cells in the range, A2through A5, are both evaluatedby the criteria and addedif they match the criteria.In this example, if A2 isgreater than 160,000, add A2,if A3 is greaterthan 160,000 add, A3 and so on.Now we're going tocreate a formula that adds the commissions for propertyvalues that are over $160,000.We start with anequal sign, SUMIF, open parentheses, select the range,comma, put the criteria in quotes,comma, select the sum_rangeand then press enter.The commissions forproperty values over $160,000 is $63,000. In this example, sum_range is defined.If A2 is greaterthan 160,000, add B2,if A3 is greater than160,000, add B3 and so on.We can also evaluatetext in a SUMIF function.Let's create a formulathat totals sales for fruits.As always, we start theformula with an equal sign,SUMIF, open parentheses, select the range, comma, put the criteria inquotes, in this case fruits,comma, select the sum_rangeand then press Enter and we see that the sales total for fruits is $2000. In this example, if A2 is equal to fruits, add C2, if A3 is equal to fruits, add C3 and so on.We can use the questionmark and asterisk wildcards ascriteria argumentsin a SUMIF function.A question mark matchesany single character and an asterisk matches anysequence of characters.Let's add the salesfor foods ending in es.Equal sign, SUMIF,open parentheses, select the range,comma, put the criteria inquotes, in this case asterisk, es,comma, select the sum_range and then press Enter, and the total sales for foods ending in es is $4300. In this example,if the last word inB2 ends in es, add C2,if the last word inB3 ends in es, add C3and so on.

Basic math,"Let Excel be your calculator.With a simple formula, Excelcan perform calculations onnumbers using operators,such as the plus sign, and functions such as SUM.To add numbers, youuse the plus sign.A formula alwaysstarts with an equal sign.If I then type a number, aplus sign, another numberand then press Enter, thecell displays the results.You can add many numbersthis way, not just two.Instead of typing numbers ina formula, you can referencecells that contain numbers to makeadding a bit easier and more flexible.A4 is equal to 6, A5 is equal to 3.I'll create a formulathat adds the cells.As with all formulas, Istart again with the equal sign,click a cell, type aplus sign, then another cell and press Enter.And if I change a number in a cell, the results of the formula automatically updates. When you double-click a cell, you can see right in the cell if it's a formulalike A6 or a number like A4or you can click a cell andlook up here in the formula bar.Subtracting is similar toadding except you use the minus sign.Click a cell, then aminus sign, then another celland press Enter.Multiplying is similar to adding and subtracting, except you use an asterisk.

Using functions,"AutoSum makes it easy to addadjacent cells in rows and columns.you could type out = A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 but that's tedious.Instead, click the cell to the rightof a row or below a column.Then on the Home tab click AutoSum,verify that the formula is whatyou want and click AutoSum again.AutoSum adds the row orcolumn automatically, it's really handy.When I double-clickinside a cell where I'm using AutoSum, I see it's aformula with a SUM function.A function is a predefinedformula, it helps save you time.The syntax or grammar ofthe SUM function is SUM, open parenthesis, arguments,like numbers or cell referencesseparated by commas andfinally close parenthesis.This formula is SUM A3:A6,the colon indicates a range of cells.This formula adds thecells from A3 through A6.When adding a few cells, thesum function saves you time;with larger ranges ofcells, it's essential.If you try to use AutoSumhere, it only gets the adjacent cell not the entire column.Why? Because B5 isempty, if B5 wasn't empty, B3 through B6 wouldbe an adjacent range of cellsthat AutoSum could recognise.To add cells in ranges of cells that aren't adjacent, SUM, holddown the Ctrl key, click the desired cells and ranges of cellsand press Enter. The formulauses the SUM function to addthe cells containing numbersand ignores the empty cells.Subtraction is similar to additionbut there isn't a subtraction function.To subtract, you usea basic formula likenumber or cell minusthe next number or cell and so on. You can sum numbers where some of them are negative.The keyboard shortcutfor AutoSum is Alt-=, and then I press Enter.This is equivalent to 6-3+4-5.You can also subtract theresults of one SUM function from another, SUM, select a range of cells,- SUM,select another range of cells and press Enter.As I mentioned about addingearlier, to multiply cellsyou could type out=A3*A4*A5 *A6 but that's tedious.To speed things up use the productfunction to multiply numbers or cells.Product is similar to theSum function but instead ofadding numbers it multiplies them.It's another example of howfunctions help save you time.The syntax of the productfunction is PRODUCT, open parenthesis, arguments likenumbers or cell references,separated by commas andfinally close parenthesis.To multiply cells inranges of cells in one formula,PRODUCT,hold down the Ctrl key, selectthe desired cells and ranges of cells and press Enter. The formulauses the product function tomultiply cells containingnumbers and ignores the empty cells.Division is similar to multiplication but there isn't a divide function.A basic formula would benumber or cell, forward slash,the next number or cell and so on.You can divide theresults of one function such asPRODUCT by the resultsof another, such as SUM.This formula divides theproduct of the cells in B3 through B6, by the sum ofthe cells in C3 through C6.",autosum make easi addadjac cell row columnsy could type a3 a4 a5 a6 that tediousinstead click cell rightof row columnthen home tab click autosumverifi formula whatyou want click autosum againautosum add row orcolumn automat realli handywhen doubleclickinsid cell im use autosum see aformula sum functiona function predefinedformula help save timeth syntax grammar ofth sum function sum open parenthesi argumentslik number cell referencessepar comma andfin close parenthesisthi formula sum a3a6th colon indic rang cellsthi formula add thecel a3 a6when ad cell thesum function save timewith larger rang ofcel essentialif tri use autosumher get adjac cell entir columnwhi b5 isempti b5 wasnt empti b3 b6 wouldb adjac rang cellsthat autosum could recogniseto add cell rang cell arent adjac sum holddown ctrl key click desir cell rang cellsand press enter formulaus sum function addth cell contain numbersand ignor empti cellssubtract similar additionbut isnt subtract functionto subtract usea basic formula likenumb cell minusth next number cell sum number negativeth keyboard shortcutfor autosum alt press enterthi equival 6345you also subtract theresult one sum function anoth sum select rang cell sumselect anoth rang cell press entera mention addingearli multipli cellsyou could type outa3a4a5 a6 that tediousto speed thing use productfunct multipli number cellsproduct similar thesum function instead ofad number multipli themit anoth exampl howfunct help save timeth syntax productfunct product open parenthesi argument likenumb cell referencessepar comma andfin close parenthesisto multipli cell inrang cell one formulaproducthold ctrl key selectth desir cell rang cell press enter formulaus product function tomultipli cell containingnumb ignor empti cellsdivis similar multipl isnt divid functiona basic formula would benumb cell forward slashth next number cell onyou divid theresult one function asproduct resultsof anoth sumthi formula divid theproduct cell b3 b6 sum ofth cell c3 c6
Operator order,"Excel uses the standard mathrules of operator order in formulas.I find the following mnemonichelpful in remembering these.Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.Parentheses first,innermost if nested,exponents, multiplicationand division, left to right and lastly, addition andsubtraction, left to right.Calculations inparentheses are evaluated first.Inner to outer if they are nested.In this example, 3+3 is in parentheses, so those numbers are added first. This leaves us with 6*5, which is 30. This is an exampleof nested parentheses.What's in the innermostpair is evaluated first.4/2 is 2 and that's added to 3 for a result of 5.Exponents are evaluated next.But they're outsidethe scope of this course.Multiplication and division areevaluated next, working from left to right.In this example, goingfrom left to right, 30/5 is 6. And 6*3 is 18.With parentheses around 5*3,this returns a different result.5*3 is evaluated firstsince it's in parentheses returning 15. Then 30 is divided by 15 resulting in 2. Last in operator order are addition and subtraction, working from left to right.In this example, workingfrom left to right, 5+3 is 8and 8-6 is 2.",excel use standard mathrul oper order formulasi find follow mnemonichelp rememb thesepleas excus dear aunt sallyparenthes firstinnermost nestedexpon multiplicationand divis left right lastli addit andsubtract left rightcalcul inparenthes evalu firstinn outer nestedin exampl 33 parenthes number ad first leav us 65 30 exampleof nest parentheseswhat innermostpair evalu first42 2 that ad 3 result 5expon evalu nextbut theyr outsideth scope coursemultipl divis areevalu next work left rightin exampl goingfrom left right 305 6 63 18with parenthes around 53thi return differ result53 evalu firstsinc parenthes return 15 30 divid 15 result 2 last oper order addit subtract work left rightin exampl workingfrom left right 53 8and 86 2
More complex formulas,"Now we'll create morecomplex formulas using multipleoperators, cellreferences and functions.We're going to calculate the salescommission based off of the net revenue.To do this, I take thesales price and subtract from itthe cost of goods sold.This is in parenthesesto ensure it occurs first.I then multiply the net profit bythe commission percentage in B4, 3%.This returns the commission.Let's take a look at howthis works in a formula.Because the cell referencesare in parentheses, first the cost of goods sold issubtracted from the sales price.This returns a net profit of $3200.This is then multiplied by 3%,returning a commission of $96.Now we're going to determinethe weighted scores for students.By weighted scores, I meanthat different tests accountfor a different percentageof the student's final grade.Test 1 and 2 each account for 10%and the midterm and finaltest each account for 40%.To do this, I multiply thetest 1 score for Bob by its weight. I press F4 after Iselect the weight value in B3so that when I copy theformula, the weight for test 1will always remain cell B3.This is referred to asabsolute cell reference.I then add Bob's midtermscore multiplied by its weightin B4 and press F4 again.I follow the same steps fortest 2 and the final test.To copy the formula, Iclick the cell, put the mouse pointer over the bottomright-hand corner of the celluntil I get a black plussign, click the left mouse button and drag theborder to the right.Here are the weightedscores for the students.Let's take a look at what's happening in this formula for Bob's weighted score. Each of the test scores and their weights are multiplied resulting in this formula.Then the numbers are addedtogether resulting in 74.5. What's the value returned by this formula?First, we do theinnermost parentheses,5-3 is 2, resulting in this formula.Next, we do theremaining parentheses,10*2 is 20 and 1-4 is -3,resulting in this formula.Now we do multiplication anddivision from left to right,6*20 is 120,divided by 3 is 40,resulting in this formula.Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. 4+40 is 44,-3 is 41.You can use functionsand formulas with multipleoperators including nested parentheses. Functions and cell references are evaluated and treated as the resulting numbers.The parentheses that followa function name act only as a container for the function'sarguments such as numbers or cell references and don't affectthe order of operations in a formula.Let's take a look at what'shappening in this formula.The functions and cell references areevaluated resulting in this formula.The operations inparentheses occur first resulting in a formula of 12-3 and this is 9.Now you've got a pretty good ideaabout how to do basic math in Excel.",well creat morecomplex formula use multipleoper cellrefer functionswer go calcul salescommiss base net revenueto take thesal price subtract itth cost good soldthi parenthesesto ensur occur firsti multipli net profit byth commiss percentag b4 3thi return commissionlet take look howthi work formulabecaus cell referencesar parenthes first cost good sold issubtract sale pricethi return net profit 3200thi multipli 3return commiss 96now go determineth weight score studentsbi weight score meanthat differ test accountfor differ percentageof student final gradetest 1 2 account 10and midterm finaltest account 40to multipli thetest 1 score bob weight press f4 iselect weight valu b3so copi theformula weight test 1will alway remain cell b3thi refer asabsolut cell referencei add bob midtermscor multipli weightin b4 press f4 againi follow step fortest 2 final testto copi formula iclick cell put mous pointer bottomrighthand corner celluntil get black plussign click left mous button drag thebord righther weightedscor studentslet take look what happen formula bob weight score test score weight multipli result formulathen number addedtogeth result 745 what valu return formulafirst theinnermost parentheses53 2 result formulanext theremain parentheses102 20 14 3result formulanow multipl anddivis left right620 120divid 3 40result formulalastli addit subtract left right 440 443 41you use functionsand formula multipleoper includ nest parenthes function cell refer evalu treat result numbersth parenthes followa function name act contain functionsargu number cell refer dont affectth order oper formulalet take look whatshappen formulath function cell refer areevalu result formulath oper inparenthes occur first result formula 123 9now youv got pretti good ideaabout basic math excel
Average a group of numbers,"You may have used AutoSumto quickly add numbers in Excel,But did you know you,can also use it to calculateother results,such as averages.Click the cell to the right of a row,or below a column.Then on the Home tab,click the AutoSum down arrow,click Average, verify the formula is what you want and press Enter.When I double-click inside the cell, I see it's a formulawith the average function.The formula is: average A2:A5,which averages thecells from A2 through A5.When averaging a few cells,the average function saves you time.With larger ranges of cells, it's essential.If I try to use the AutoSum average option here,it only uses Cell C5,not the entire column.Why? Because C4 is blank.If C4 contained a number,C2 through C5 would bean adjacent range of cells,that AutoSum would recognise.To average values and cellsand ranges of cells that aren't adjacent,type an equal sign, a formula always starts with an equal sign,Average,open parenthesis,hold down the Ctrl key,click the desired cells and ranges of cells,and press Enter.The formula uses theAverage function to average the cells containing numbersand ignores the empty cells or those containing text.Up next, Averageif.",may use autosumto quickli add number excelbut know youcan also use calculateoth resultssuch averagesclick cell right rowor columnthen home tabclick autosum arrowclick averag verifi formula want press enterwhen doubleclick insid cell see formulawith averag functionth formula averag a2a5which averag thecel a2 a5when averag cellsth averag function save timewith larger rang cell essentialif tri use autosum averag option hereit use cell c5not entir columnwhi c4 blankif c4 contain numberc2 c5 would bean adjac rang cellsthat autosum would recogniseto averag valu cellsand rang cell arent adjacenttyp equal sign formula alway start equal signaverageopen parenthesishold ctrl keyclick desir cell rang cellsand press enterth formula use theaverag function averag cell contain numbersand ignor empti cell contain textup next averageif
AVERAGEIF function,"The AVERAGEIF functionreturns the average of cells in a range that meet criteria you provide.Let's determine the average forsales that are greater than $60,000.Type an equal sign, AVERAGEIF,opening parenthesis.In this example,we're going to evaluate and average the same range of cells C2 to C5in the sales column,comma, then we type the criteria against whichthe range is evaluated,enclosed in quotes.You put it in quotes so Excelinterprets the operator and value correctly.In this example,greater than 60,000don't type a comma in 60,000,Excel would interpret that as a separator for arguments of the function and return an error; and press Enter.Excel automatically adds theclosing parenthesis to the formula.The average for cells greaterthan $60,000 is 71,229.Let's walk through this.The function evaluates howmany cells in the cells columnmeet the criteria ofgreater than 60,000.There are 3 cells,the function then averages these cells.Now we'll use the AVERAGEIF function to determine the average for sales where thenumber of orders is greater than 50.In this example,one range of cells is evaluated againstthe criteria and a secondrange of cells is averaged.We type equal sign, AVERAGEIF,opening parenthesis,the range of cells we want evaluated,cells B2 through B5in the number of orders column, comma,the criteria by which the range is to be evaluated, enclosed in quotes,greater than 50, comma,the range of the cells we want to average.Cells C2 through C5 inthe sales column,And press Enter.The average for saleswhere the number of orders isgreater than 50 is $66,487.Let's walk through this one too.First the function evaluateswhich cells in B2 through B5meet the criteria ofgreater than 50.Three cells meet the criteria.The function then averages the cells from the cells column where the criteria is met by the corresponding cell in column B.Up next,weighted average.",averageif functionreturn averag cell rang meet criteria providelet determin averag forsal greater 60000type equal sign averageifopen parenthesisin examplewer go evalu averag rang cell c2 c5in sale columncomma type criteria whichth rang evaluatedenclos quotesy put quot excelinterpret oper valu correctlyin examplegreat 60000dont type comma 60000excel would interpret separ argument function return error press enterexcel automat add theclos parenthesi formulath averag cell greaterthan 60000 71229let walk thisth function evalu howmani cell cell columnmeet criteria ofgreat 60000there 3 cellsth function averag cellsnow well use averageif function determin averag sale thenumb order greater 50in exampleon rang cell evalu againstth criteria secondrang cell averagedw type equal sign averageifopen parenthesisth rang cell want evaluatedcel b2 b5in number order column commath criteria rang evalu enclos quotesgreat 50 commath rang cell want averagecel c2 c5 inth sale columnand press enterth averag saleswher number order isgreat 50 66487let walk one toofirst function evaluateswhich cell b2 b5meet criteria ofgreat 50three cell meet criteriath function averag cell cell column criteria met correspond cell column bup nextweight averag
Weighted average,"Usually, when youcalculate an average, all of the numbers are given equal significance. The numbers are added together and thendivided by the number of numbers,as in this example, whichreturns an unweighted average of 5.With a weighted average,one or more numbers is given a greater significance or weight.In this example, themidterm and final exams have a greater weight than test 1 and 2.We'll use the SUMPRODUCT and SUM functions to determine the weighted average.The SUMPRODUCT functionmultiplies each test scoreby its weight and then adds these resulting numbers.We then divide the outcomeof sum product by the sum of the weights.And this returns theweighted average of 80.SUMPRODUCT is essentiallythe sum of test 1 times its weight, plus the midterm times its weight and so on.To get the weighted average, youdivide by the total of the weights.If we had justaveraged the test scores,the value would be 75.5, a significant difference.Now you've got a pretty good ideaabout how to average numbers in Excel.",usual youcalcul averag number given equal signific number ad togeth thendivid number numbersa exampl whichreturn unweight averag 5with weight averageon number given greater signific weightin exampl themidterm final exam greater weight test 1 2well use sumproduct sum function determin weight averageth sumproduct functionmultipli test scorebi weight add result numbersw divid outcomeof sum product sum weightsand return theweight averag 80sumproduct essentiallyth sum test 1 time weight plu midterm time weight onto get weight averag youdivid total weightsif justaverag test scoresth valu would 755 signific differencenow youv got pretti good ideaabout averag number excel

"Create pie, bar, and line charts","We created a clustered columnchart in the previous video.In this video, we'regoing to create pie, bar and line charts. Each type of chart highlights data differently and some charts can'tbe used with some types of data.We'll go over this shortly.To create a pie chart,select the cells you want to chart, click Quickanalysis and click Charts.Excel displays recommendedoptions based on the data in the cells you select. So the options won't always be the same.I'll show you how to create a chart that isn't a quick analysis option shortly.Click the pie option and your chart's created. You can chart only one data series with a pie chart. In this example, those are the cells figures in cells B2 through B5.I'm going to move and resize the chart so it displays without having to scroll,which will also make it easier to customise; something we'll look at in the next video.I click the chart, hold down theleft mouse button and drag to move it.I scroll down a little,click the bottom right-hand corner of the chart and drag it upinto the left to make it smaller. Different data displays betterin different types of charts.If you try to graph too much datain a pie chart, it looks like this.Not very useful.Now I'm creating a bar chart using the same data we used to create the pie chart. Charting the same data different ways can provide you with a different perspective that may help youdiscover different insights in the data.We're creating some of themore common chart types but there are many more options.To create charts thataren't quick analysis options,select the cells youwant to chart, click the Insert tab; in the Chartsgroup we have a lot of options.Click Recommended charts tosee the charts that will workbest with the data you've selected.Click All chartsfor even more options.These are all of the differenttypes of charts you can create.As I mentioned earlier, apie chart isn't a recommendedoption for the data we selectedbecause it can only display one data series.We can make a pie chart butit would only show the first data series, the averageprecipitation for New York and on the second data series, theaverage precipitation for Seattle.Instead, let's make aline with markers chart.Click Line, click Linewith marker, point to an option and you get a preview of the chart; click OK.We've created our line chart.",creat cluster columnchart previou videoin video werego creat pie bar line chart type chart highlight data differ chart cantb use type datawel go shortlyto creat pie chartselect cell want chart click quickanalysi click chartsexcel display recommendedopt base data cell select option wont alway sameil show creat chart isnt quick analysi option shortlyclick pie option chart creat chart one data seri pie chart exampl cell figur cell b2 b5im go move resiz chart display without scrollwhich also make easier customis someth well look next videoi click chart hold theleft mous button drag move iti scroll littleclick bottom righthand corner chart drag upinto left make smaller differ data display betterin differ type chartsif tri graph much datain pie chart look like thisnot usefulnow im creat bar chart use data use creat pie chart chart data differ way provid differ perspect may help youdiscov differ insight datawer creat themor common chart type mani optionsto creat chart thatar quick analysi optionsselect cell youwant chart click insert tab chartsgroup lot optionsclick recommend chart tose chart workbest data youv selectedclick chartsfor even optionsthes differenttyp chart createa mention earlier api chart isnt recommendedopt data selectedbecaus display one data seriesw make pie chart butit would show first data seri averageprecipit new york second data seri theaverag precipit seattleinstead let make alin marker chartclick line click linewith marker point option get preview chart click okwev creat line chart

Top tips for working in Excel Online,"When your Excel web appworksheet is a crowd of data,changing the formatting ofnumbers and text can help make information stand out.Let's look at three ways to make this worksheet easier to read with formatting.One way is to change howthe text or numbers in a cell look by changing font style, size or color. Column or row titles are a great place for this.

Three ways to add numbers in Excel Online,"Let's look at three ways to addnumbers in my company sales spreadsheet.Perhaps the easiest way isto select a set of numbers in rows or columns and look for the sum of those numbersdown here on the status bar.Another way to add numbersin multiple rows or columns is to use AutoSum on the Home tab.I need to add the productsales from each quarter to find out the total sales for the year.That way I can see whichitem is our best-seller.I select the first empty cellsto the right of my rows of data.I click AutoSum. Don't worry if you get a column of hashtag symbols, that just means that your column is too narrow for your set of numbers.Double-click the rightborder of your column to expand the width and the sales numbers will appear.I will add a titleto this new column.I can do the same thingto get my quarterly totals.I select the first emptycells below each of my columnsand click AutoSumand I'll add a title to this new row of numbers.The nice thing about AutoSum is thatit recalculates if you change numbers.I have to correct thisnumber and when I do, both the yearly total and thequarterly total update automatically, no need to fusswith formulas to recalculate.AutoSum works best when you'reworking with only sequential numbers.No blank cells or text.If you need to add rows orcolumns containing blank ortext cells, create aformula with the SUM function.A SUM function can addnumbers whether the cells are in a sequence or range or just a bunchof individual unconnected cells.I want to add these numbersplus the number in this cell.In an empty cell, Itype the =, SUM and then opening parenthesis,then I select this celland drag my selection to this cell.To add to this formula, Itype a comma, select the other cell and then type aclosing parenthesis.The sum function adds allthe numbers in the range of cells in the individual cell I selected.And just like AutoSum, ifany of the cells change, the SUM function updates automatically.Now you've got top tipsfor working in Excel web app.",let look three way addnumb compani sale spreadsheetperhap easiest way isto select set number row column look sum numbersdown statu baranoth way add numbersin multipl row column use autosum home tabi need add productsal quarter find total sale yearthat way see whichitem bestselleri select first empti cellsto right row datai click autosum dont worri get column hashtag symbol mean column narrow set numbersdoubleclick rightbord column expand width sale number appeari add titleto new columni thingto get quarterli totalsi select first emptycel columnsand click autosumand ill add titl new row numbersth nice thing autosum thatit recalcul chang numbersi correct thisnumb yearli total thequarterli total updat automat need fusswith formula recalculateautosum work best yourework sequenti numbersno blank cell textif need add row orcolumn contain blank ortext cell creat aformula sum functiona sum function addnumb whether cell sequenc rang bunchof individu unconnect cellsi want add numbersplu number cellin empti cell ityp sum open parenthesisthen select celland drag select cellto add formula ityp comma select cell type aclos parenthesisth sum function add allth number rang cell individu cell selectedand like autosum ifani cell chang sum function updat automaticallynow youv got top tipsfor work excel web app
Cell references,"In Excel, one of the key thingsyou'll calculate are values in cells.Cells are the boxes yousee in the grid of an Excel worksheet, like this one. Each cell is identified on a worksheetby its reference, the column letter and row number thatintersect at the cells location.This cell is in column Dand row 5, so it's cell D5. The column always comesfirst in a cell reference.When you use cell references in a formula, in this case, I'm adding cells A2 and B2,Excel calculates the answer usingthe numbers in the referenced cells.When I change the value on acell, the formula calculatesthe new result automatically.Instead of typing eachindividual cell in a formula, you can reference multiple adjacentcells called a range of cells.This range of cells isreferred to as F2:G5.The first cell is F2and the last cell is G5.You always start aformula with an equal sign.I'm using the SUM function in theformula to add this range of cells.And there we have the sum ortotal for the range of cells.",excel one key thingsyoul calcul valu cellscel box youse grid excel worksheet like one cell identifi worksheetbi refer column letter row number thatintersect cell locationthi cell column dand row 5 cell d5 column alway comesfirst cell referencewhen use cell refer formula case im ad cell a2 b2excel calcul answer usingth number referenc cellswhen chang valu acel formula calculatesth new result automaticallyinstead type eachindividu cell formula refer multipl adjacentcel call rang cellsthi rang cell isref f2g5the first cell f2and last cell g5you alway start aformula equal signim use sum function theformula add rang cellsand sum ortot rang cell
Copying formulas,"We just saw how to create aformula that adds 2 cells.now let's copythe formula down the column,so it adds the other pairs of cells.The formula in C2, is A2+B2.To copy it, put the mouse pointer over the bottom right-hand cornerof the cell until it's a black plus sign.Click and hold the leftmouse button and drag the plussign over the cells you want to fill;and the formula is copied into the other cells.But the formula wasn't just copied.If it was just copied,all of the cells with theformula would have remained A2 + B2.And by looking at the results in each cell,that obviously hasn't happened.Copying the formulafrom C2 to C3 increased the relative position of theformula by 1 row but didn't change the column.The formula in C2 was A2+B2.The formula in C3 is A3+B3.The cell references in the formula increased by one row.The formulas in C4 andC5 updated similarly,this is called a relative cellreference and it's the default for Excel.But you don't always want cellreferences to change when you copy a formula.In this example F2 is divided by E2and we want the other numbers incolumn F to be divided by E2 as well.In other words, we want E2 to not change when the formula is copied.We can do that by making thereference absolute instead of relative.If we copy the formula likewe did before we get an error.For example,in G3 the copied formula is F3,which is 12 divided by E3 which is blank.Excel interprets a blank cell asa zero and that's a math error.To make E2 an absolute cell reference,I type a dollar sign before the E,and a dollar sign before the 2 and press Enter.Now when we copy the formulawe get the results we expect.When we look at theformula in G3, the first cellreference did update,as expected, but the E2 absolute cell reference didn't update. Neat.Now you've got a pretty good idea aboutwhat cell referencesare and how to use them.",saw creat aformula add 2 cellsnow let copyth formula columnso add pair cellsth formula c2 a2b2to copi put mous pointer bottom righthand cornerof cell black plu signclick hold leftmous button drag plussign cell want filland formula copi cellsbut formula wasnt copiedif copiedal cell theformula would remain a2 b2and look result cellthat obvious hasnt happenedcopi formulafrom c2 c3 increas rel posit theformula 1 row didnt chang columnth formula c2 a2b2th formula c3 a3b3th cell refer formula increas one rowth formula c4 andc5 updat similarlythi call rel cellrefer default excelbut dont alway want cellrefer chang copi formulain exampl f2 divid e2and want number incolumn f divid e2 wellin word want e2 chang formula copiedw make therefer absolut instead relativeif copi formula likew get errorfor examplein g3 copi formula f3which 12 divid e3 blankexcel interpret blank cell asa zero that math errorto make e2 absolut cell referencei type dollar sign eand dollar sign 2 press enternow copi formulaw get result expectwhen look theformula g3 first cellrefer updatea expect e2 absolut cell refer didnt updat neatnow youv got pretti good idea aboutwhat cell referencesar use
AutoFill and Flash Fill,"Sometimes you need toenter a lot of repetitiveinformation in Excel,such as dates,and it can be really tedious.If you think there might bean easier automated way to do this,you'd be right.Type the first date in the series,put the mouse pointer overthe bottom right hand corner of the cell,until it's a black plus sign,click and hold the left mouse button and drag theplus sign over the cells you want to fill. And voila.The series is filled in for youautomatically usingthe autofill feature.Or say you have informationin Excel that isn't formattedthe way you need it to be,such as this list of names.And going through the entire listmanually to correct them is daunting.You'd think there'd be an easierautomated way to do this too;and you'd be right again.Type the first namethe way you want it,start to type the nextname and as if by magic,Excel provides a preview of thenames formatted the way you want.Press enter and the namesare filled in for you using the flash fill featurethat's new in Excel.Autofill and flash fill aretremendous timesavers;and they can do much more thanwe've covered in this introduction.",sometim need toenter lot repetitiveinform excelsuch datesand realli tediousif think might bean easier autom way thisyoud righttyp first date seriesput mous pointer overth bottom right hand corner celluntil black plu signclick hold left mous button drag theplu sign cell want fill voilath seri fill youautomat usingth autofil featureor say informationin excel isnt formattedth way need besuch list namesand go entir listmanu correct dauntingyoud think there easierautom way tooand youd right againtyp first nameth way want itstart type nextnam magicexcel provid preview thenam format way wantpress enter namesar fill use flash fill featurethat new excelautofil flash fill aretremend timesaversand much thanwev cover introduct
AutoFill,"In the previous video,you saw how auto fillautomatically fills a series down acolumn of adjacent cells like this.But it can also go up acolumn to the right and the left in a row.When I move the cursor overwhat's called the fill handleand it turns into a black plus sign, this time I hold down the right mousebutton while I drag.When I let go of the mouse button,I'm presented with a list of options.Copy cells is pretty straightforward.Auto fill copies what's inthe A2 cell to the adjacent cells I selected. It even workswith cells containing formulas.We just copy the data from a single cell, but you can also copy multiple cells like this.Fill series populates theadjacent cells with data thatfollows a patternin the copied cells.And as expected, theformulas update automatically.You can also fill aseries with time, like this.You can even change theresults of fill series by givingExcel more data tobase the series on.In this example, I'm creating aseries that's every half hour.Auto fill has many options whencreating a series based on calendar data.With dates you can fill days, weeks,months and years.When you're workingwith days of the week,you can fill in allseven days or just weekdays.You can even create a seriesfor quarters based on datesand based on abbreviations, and you can create a series of years.",previou videoy saw auto fillautomat fill seri acolumn adjac cell like thisbut also go acolumn right left rowwhen move cursor overwhat call fill handleand turn black plu sign time hold right mousebutton dragwhen let go mous buttonim present list optionscopi cell pretti straightforwardauto fill copi what inth a2 cell adjac cell select even workswith cell contain formulasw copi data singl cell also copi multipl cell like thisfil seri popul theadjac cell data thatfollow patternin copi cellsand expect theformula updat automaticallyy also fill aseri time like thisyou even chang theresult fill seri givingexcel data tobas seri onin exampl im creat aseri that everi half hourauto fill mani option whencreat seri base calendar datawith date fill day weeksmonth yearswhen your workingwith day weekyou fill allseven day weekdaysy even creat seriesfor quarter base datesand base abbrevi creat seri year
Flash Fill,"In the first video, yousaw how flash fill canautomatically fill inand format a list of names.But it can work with manydifferent types of data.I'm typing phone numbersthe way I want them formatted.When flash fill recognizes apattern, it provides a preview.To accept it and fill inthe column, I press Enter.To use flash fill, I need to be in acolumn next to the data I want changed.I also use uniqueformatting on the top row.This helps flash fillunderstand that the top row is a header row so it won't useit in determining a pattern.The phone numbersuse the general format.This column is formatted as a number.Flash fill isn't triggeredautomatically for data formatted as a number.There are only 10 unique characters and it's too easy to come up with random patterns, like this, the dates aren't correct. For example, this date should be 5/27/1974 not 2/27/1974.Providing an additional example willhelp flash fill understand the pattern.We'll add another date,the way we want it formatted.We'll select the cells, we can use the fill handle or the flash fill button on the Data taband now flash fill accurately fills in the dates.In the first video, you saw how flash fill can help you combine and format names.In this example, we'll do a more advanced version of that.I type the last name, firstname and the middle initialwith the desiredpunctuation and capitalization.When I start typing thesecond name, flash fill makessuggestions for therest of the names.It's not perfect,but it's pretty close.So I press Enter. In this case, flash fill wasn't sure what to do for names thatdon't have a middle name or initial.By providing flash fill withan example of how to handle these names, it fills in the other name.You can also use flash fillto split up a column of data.Type the first name,start to type the nextand flash fill makes a suggestionfor the rest of the first names.They look good, so I press Enter.We do the samething for the last name.Now you've got a pretty good ideaabout how to use auto fill and flash fill.",first video yousaw flash fill canautomat fill inand format list namesbut work manydiffer type dataim type phone numbersth way want formattedwhen flash fill recogn apattern provid previewto accept fill inth column press enterto use flash fill need acolumn next data want changedi also use uniqueformat top rowthi help flash fillunderstand top row header row wont useit determin patternth phone numbersus gener formatthi column format numberflash fill isnt triggeredautomat data format numberther 10 uniqu charact easi come random pattern like date arent correct exampl date 5271974 2271974provid addit exampl willhelp flash fill understand patternwel add anoth dateth way want formattedwel select cell use fill handl flash fill button data taband flash fill accur fill datesin first video saw flash fill help combin format namesin exampl well advanc version thati type last name firstnam middl initialwith desiredpunctu capitalizationwhen start type thesecond name flash fill makessuggest therest namesit perfectbut pretti closeso press enter case flash fill wasnt sure name thatdont middl name initialbi provid flash fill withan exampl handl name fill namey also use flash fillto split column datatyp first namestart type nextand flash fill make suggestionfor rest first namesthey look good press enterw sameth last namenow youv got pretti good ideaabout use auto fill flash fill
Add time,"You can add time in Excel justlike you add other types of numbers.For example, you might dothis if you want to know howlong it took tocomplete a project's tasks.The best way to do this is to usethe AutoSum button on the Home tab.I click it once to seewhat it's going to add.This is what I want.So I click it again and getthe total time for the tasks.You could use AutoSum againto add these columns tasks or a formula to add these two cells.To start a formula, youalways use an equal sign.Click Cell D2, type +, click cell D3 and press Enter.Hum. 12 hours and 45minutes + 15 hours and 30 minutes isn't 4 hours and 15 minutes.I know the formula iscorrect, so it must be how cell D4is configured to display time.In this example, the totalwas greater than 24 hours.Excel can display time inmany different ways such as hours and minutes orhours, minutes and seconds,AM-PM or a 24-hour clockor a number that's greater than 24hours as is needed in this example.To format the cell, rightclick it and click Format cells.Under Category, click Custom.In the type field,type left square bracket,h, right square bracket, colonand then mm. The square brackets tell Excel to exceed 24 hours.The h is for hours andthe mm is for minutes.See the course summary atthe end of this course for more information aboutformatting time and now we just click OK and the total timeis displayed correctly.You can use the square bracketseven if the time won't exceed 24 hours.If you're not sure if a total willexceed 24 hours, it's best to use them.You can also add a unit oftime such as one and a half hour to a time of day such as 10 a.m. by using the time function.Type in equal sign, thenclick A7 which contains the time of day 10 a.m.then type a plus sign, time,left parenthesis, 1 forthe number of hours we want to add, comma, 30 for the minutes we want to add, comma, 0 for the seconds, a closingparenthesis and press Enter.And we have ourcalculated time of 11:30 a.m.",add time excel justlik add type numbersfor exampl might dothi want know howlong took tocomplet project tasksth best way useth autosum button home tabi click seewhat go addthi wantso click getth total time tasksyou could use autosum againto add column task formula add two cellsto start formula youalway use equal signclick cell d2 type click cell d3 press enterhum 12 hour 45minut 15 hour 30 minut isnt 4 hour 15 minutesi know formula iscorrect must cell d4i configur display timein exampl totalwa greater 24 hoursexcel display time inmani differ way hour minut orhour minut secondsampm 24hour clockor number that greater 24hour need exampleto format cell rightclick click format cellsund categori click customin type fieldtyp left squar bracketh right squar bracket colonand mm squar bracket tell excel exceed 24 hoursth h hour andth mm minutesse cours summari atth end cours inform aboutformat time click ok total timei display correctlyy use squar bracketseven time wont exceed 24 hoursif your sure total willexce 24 hour best use themyou also add unit oftim one half hour time day 10 use time functiontyp equal sign thenclick a7 contain time day 10 amthen type plu sign timeleft parenthesi 1 forth number hour want add comma 30 minut want add comma 0 second closingparenthesi press enterand ourcalcul time 1130
Subtract time,"You subtract time in Excel, almost like you subtract other types of numbers.The one exception isthat Excel doesn't support a negative number formatted as time.Excel displays negative time,as an endless series of numbers signs.In this example, we want tofigure out how many hours a person worked, and we want the results displayed as a number with a fraction of an hour;such as 6.50 hours as opposed to 6:30,6 hours and 30 minutes.Time is stored in Excel asa fraction of a 24 hour day.So 12 pm would be 0.5, half a day.To go from half a day to hours,we need to multiply it by 24 hours in a day.Enough said, let's subtract time.To do this, you use a formula.There isn't an auto-subtract button.Type an equal sign,open parenthesis, click cell C2,type a minus sign, click cell B2,type a closing parenthesis,asterisk, which multiplies numbers,24 for 24 hours in a day.The parenthesis ensure thatsubtraction occurs first,and the resulting numberis then multiplied by 24,And press Enter.And we see that Richard worked: 6.5 hours.I want 2 digitsafter the decimal.So I right click the cell,and click Format Cells.Under Category, I click Number.The default is 2digits, so I click OK.To fill in the rest of thecells, you don't have to typethe formula multiple times.Click the cell with the formula,put the mouse pointer over the bottom right hand corneruntil it becomes a black plus sign,click and hold the left mouse button,and drag the plus sign over the cells you want to fill.The formula and formattingare copied into the cells.In this example, theelapsed time is greater than 24 hours, and I want it shown as time, not a number.I type an equal sign,click cell C7, type a minus sign, clickcell B7 and press Enter.To format the cell to showthe results the way I want it,I right click the cell andclick Format Cells.Under Category, I click Custom.In the type list, I scroll downto the square bracket formatwe created in theadd-time video and click OK.The elapsed time is31 hours and 30 minutes.You can also subtract aunit of time, such as one and a half hours from a time ofday such as 10 am by using the time function.I type an equal sign,click A10, type a minus sign,TIME, left parenthesis,1 for the number of hours we wantto subtract, comma, 30 for the minutes we want to subtract, comma, 0 for the seconds, a closingparenthesis, and press Enter.And we have ourcalculated time of 8:30 am.Now you've got a pretty good ideaabout how to add and subtract time.Of course there'salways more to learn.",subtract time excel almost like subtract type numbersth one except isthat excel doesnt support neg number format timeexcel display neg timea endless seri number signsin exampl want tofigur mani hour person work want result display number fraction hoursuch 650 hour oppos 6306 hour 30 minutestim store excel asa fraction 24 hour dayso 12 pm would 05 half dayto go half day hoursw need multipli 24 hour dayenough said let subtract timeto use formulather isnt autosubtract buttontyp equal signopen parenthesi click cell c2type minu sign click cell b2type close parenthesisasterisk multipli numbers24 24 hour dayth parenthesi ensur thatsubtract occur firstand result numberi multipli 24and press enterand see richard work 65 hoursi want 2 digitsaft decimalso right click celland click format cellsund categori click numberth default 2digit click okto fill rest thecel dont typeth formula multipl timesclick cell formulaput mous pointer bottom right hand corneruntil becom black plu signclick hold left mous buttonand drag plu sign cell want fillth formula formattingar copi cellsin exampl theelaps time greater 24 hour want shown time numberi type equal signclick cell c7 type minu sign clickcel b7 press enterto format cell showth result way want iti right click cell andclick format cellsund categori click customin type list scroll downto squar bracket formatw creat theaddtim video click okth elaps time is31 hour 30 minutesy also subtract aunit time one half hour time ofday 10 use time functioni type equal signclick a10 type minu signtim left parenthesis1 number hour wantto subtract comma 30 minut want subtract comma 0 second closingparenthesi press enterand ourcalcul time 830 amnow youv got pretti good ideaabout add subtract timeof cours theresalway learn
Insert headers and footers,"You can add headers to the top, andfooters to the bottom of a worksheet.When you print the worksheet,the headers and footers also print.For example, you mightcreate a header with the file path,and a footer with page numbers.Headers and footers display only inPage Layout view and on printed pages.Select the worksheet youwant to add a header or a footer to,click the Insert tab,and click Header and footer.This displays theworksheet in Page Layout view.The header and footer toolsDesign tab appears, and by default, the cursor is in thecenter section of the header.I'm selecting the left section.I want to add the file path to it,so I click the file path button.I click anywhere else on theworksheet, and the file pathdisplays in the left sectionof the header on all pages.To add a footer, scrollto the bottom of the page,select the section of the footer you want to add something to, on the Design tab, click an element such as page number, click anywhere else on the worksheetand page numbers nowdisplay in the footer.There are otherelements on the Design tab.Check them out.You can also just typeinformation in a header and footer.Select the section youwant to add text to, and type your text.When you're done, you mightwant to return to normal page viewto have more roomto work on your worksheet.Click the worksheet,click the View tab,and click the Normal button.Up next, page numbering in depth.",add header top andfoot bottom worksheetwhen print worksheetth header footer also printfor exampl mightcreat header file pathand footer page numbershead footer display inpag layout view print pagesselect worksheet youwant add header footer toclick insert taband click header footerthi display theworksheet page layout viewth header footer toolsdesign tab appear default cursor thecent section headerim select left sectioni want add file path itso click file path buttoni click anywher els theworksheet file pathdisplay left sectionof header pagesto add footer scrollto bottom pageselect section footer want add someth design tab click element page number click anywher els worksheetand page number nowdisplay footerther otherel design tabcheck outyou also typeinform header footerselect section youwant add text type textwhen your done mightwant return normal page viewto roomto work worksheetclick worksheetclick view taband click normal buttonup next page number depth
Page numbers in depth,"Adding page numbers to aworksheet is one of the mostcommon uses of headers and footers.You can use a predefined header orfooter option to add page numbers.On the Insert tab, clickthe header and footer button,on the Design tab, clickthe header or footer button.There are many options andthey're the same for header and footer.Click an option from thedropdown list, such as Page 1 of ?and page numbers are added to the header of footer of the worksheet.As you probably noticed,predefined headers and footersoverwrite existing headers and footers.By default, Excel numbersand prints pages from the top down,and then left toright on the worksheet.In this example, page 2should be the page to the right,since the tablecouldn't all fit on page 1.To fix this, clickthe Page Layout tab,and click Print titles.In the Page Setup dialogbox, on the sheet tab,click Over, then down and click OK.And the pages arenow numbered correctly.If you want page numbers tostart at a number other than 1,3 for example,double click the section with a page number,after the page right square bracket, type a + sign,the number you want to increase the pages by,2 in this example and a space.Click anywhere in the worksheet and the page numbers now start at 3.

Get going fast,"When you see Excel for the firsttime, you'll notice some changes.First, there is a ribbonwhere the menu bar used to be,all of your favorite commands are still there but now they're easier to get to.For example, here's where your formatting buttons are and here's where you insert things like tables and pictures, here to check spelling,go to the Review tab.Look at this, styles, pictures, diagrams, tables,new ways to useanalysis and design tools like charts, the commands and options to work with the chart are right there on the page.The file format is new, nowwhen you save a new workbook,you'll create an xlsx filenot an xls file but don't worry you can open and save xls files just in case you need an open workbook fromsomeone working in Excel 2003.Look what happens now when you click File, this is the backstage where you go tomanage workbook in Excel options.The backstage is also whereyou go to save and open filesand also where you go toshare and export your workbooks.So we've just shown you aquick overview of what's changed.Now let's go into more detail.",see excel firsttim youll notic changesfirst ribbonwher menu bar use beall favorit command still theyr easier get tofor exampl here format button here insert thing like tabl pictur check spellinggo review tablook style pictur diagram tablesnew way useanalysi design tool like chart command option work chart right pageth file format new nowwhen save new workbookyoul creat xlsx filenot xl file dont worri open save xl file case need open workbook fromsomeon work excel 2003look happen click file backstag go tomanag workbook excel optionsth backstag also wherey go save open filesand also go toshar export workbooksso weve shown aquick overview what changednow let go detail
A first look at Excel 2016,"When you open Excel for thefirst time, this is what you see.It's a little different from the blank worksheet you're used to when you open Excel 2003.Now you start by choosingwhat you want to do, you can use a template and create a new workbook or open an existing workbook here.Let's see what happens whenyou open an Excel 2003 workbook.It looks about the same andit works about the same tooand all the basic tools andfeatures you're used to are still here, you type and format texts and numbers the same way, the commands arejust organized differently.You used to select a menuitem then click a command,now you select a tab on theribbon and click a command.By default the Home tab isselected when you first open Excel and if you just wantto get up to speed fast, this is where you'll find the most commoncommands for working with your data.For example, let's selectthe header row and change the background color and font color. If you want to save time, you can click here and choose the cell style.Notice that you can move themouse over a style and see a preview before you select it.When it comes time to save your workbook, you can use the save command up here or you can use the familiar keyboard shortcut Ctrl-S. What's that?This is the compatibilitychecker, it appeared becausewe're saving an xls filethat was created in Excel 2003and it's found that theformatting we just added mightnot look right when we open thefile in an older version of Excel.Click Continue tosave the file anyway.Now let's see how thefile looks in Excel 2003.In this case everythingseems to be OK, so let's take a closer look at the message that appeared, it comes up every time we save the file.You can clear this checkboxto make the message go awaybut as you can see uphere, you're still running incompatibility mode because Excel issaving the file in the old xls format.Excel will essentially workthe same way as it always hasbut you'll miss out on afew new features like, for example, when we select a chart, this button would normally show a list ofchart styles we could use but because we're in compatibilitymode that feature is unavailable.So if you don't need toopen a file in Excel 2003, the best thing to do is toconvert to the new xlsx format and here's how to do that.Click the File tab to go to the backstage; with Info selected here, click Convert,click OK to perform the conversion and then click Yes to reopen the workbook so thatyou can use the new features.Now we select the chart, wehave a whole range of chart styles to choose from;again you can preview the styles before you select one.

How things are organized,"So your first question might bewhy did Microsoft redesign Office?Worked fine before.Well the answer is simply tomake the programs easier to use.Of course you can work anyway you want, but the commandsI use most often areright here in the workbook.First there is the rightclick menu, then there's something new called theMini toolbar, which is great fordoing quick formattingtasks like adding some fill.When you simply select some data, this button appears, the quick analysis lens,with this you can instantly add things to help you visualize yourdata, like conditional formatting.The commands I use fairlyoften are located on the ribbon.The ribbon commandsare organized into tabs,and the tab commands areorganized into groups,we'll look at those in moredetail in the next video.The commands I use less often can be found by clicking one of these little arrows, they open dialog boxes.Look familiar? Many of themare identical to the ones you used in Excel 2003.Finally,to get to the commands I use least often,go to the backstage,this is where you open,save, share and export files.You can also click print tosee a print preview.Set up your printer and print your workbook.The options I use evenless frequently are here in OptionsThis is where you setup General Excel Preferences.Options is also where youcome to customize the commandsand options you see on the ribbon.So that's basicallyhow things are organized.Up next we'll take acloser look at the ribbon.",first question might bewhi microsoft redesign officework fine beforewel answer simpli tomak program easier useof cours work anyway want commandsi use often areright workbookfirst rightclick menu there someth new call themini toolbar great fordo quick formattingtask like ad fillwhen simpli select data button appear quick analysi lenswith instantli add thing help visual yourdata like condit formattingth command use fairlyoften locat ribbonth ribbon commandsar organ tabsand tab command areorgan groupswel look moredetail next videoth command use less often found click one littl arrow open dialog boxeslook familiar mani themar ident one use excel 2003finallyto get command use least oftengo backstagethi opensav share export filesy also click print tose print previewset printer print workbookth option use evenless frequent optionsthi setup gener excel preferencesopt also youcom custom commandsand option see ribbonso that basicallyhow thing organizedup next well take aclos look ribbon
A closer look at the ribbon,"Let's look at the commandson the ribbon more closely,we've already covered theHome tab, these are the ribboncommands you will probably usemost often as you work on a worksheet.Commands for copying,pasting, the format painter.Here are commands for formatting thefonts and numbers, and adding a style.For example we can selectthis data and then format it as a table.Look through the gallery and choose a style,our data has aheader row so click OK.With the table selected weget a special tab, this one is for working with the table's design.Let's add a total row, when you click outside the table.Now let's see what's on the insert tab, this is where you go to add something like a chart or an illustration.Let's add a picture.The first thing you'llneed to do is resize it to fitusing the corner resize handles, then you can move it where you want on the worksheet, with the picture selected you get thepicture tools format tab.I'm going to click crop andthen crop up a part of this wall,so it looks better on the page.The insert tab also hassome new tools you might check out on your own, likescreenshot and spark lines.On the page layout tab youhave commands for working withthe setup of your pagesand alignment of elements.You can also select atheme for your workbook,which applies a professionallooking set of fonts and colors to everything, select the one you like,you can then use chartoptions to choose how you want toapply the themecolors to your charts.The formulas tab is whereyou'll find the function libraryand other formularelated commands,for example you can click hereto show your formulas.Let's add a column to thisdata and then add a formulathat adds the data in theother columns, you could writea formula manually, but whydo that, when you can insertan auto sum function?Click sum and Excel adds the function and auto completesthe arguments in the formula for you.Press enter.Now you can take it one step further and drag thislittle green handle to auto-fillthe formula to the other cells.The data tab has commandsfor working with data,for example you can connect toexternal data sources with these commands, and click here toaccess the data connection wizard.The Review tab has the spell checker and commands to add and review comments.And finally the View tabhas commands and options forchanging how you view your worksheets, for example you can remove grid lines,click freeze panes to keep header rows or columns from scrolling.One more thing you may beinterested in is headers and footers.you get to them by clicking page layout view and clicking here.Yes, Excel Now lets you work with your worksheets as theyappear on the printed page.After you've added andformatted your data and inserted your charts and pivottables, it's time to save, print,export or share your workbook.",let look commandson ribbon closelywev alreadi cover thehom tab ribboncommand probabl usemost often work worksheetcommand copyingpast format painterher command format thefont number ad stylefor exampl selectthi data format tablelook galleri choos styleour data ahead row click okwith tabl select weget special tab one work tabl designlet add total row click outsid tablenow let see what insert tab go add someth like chart illustrationlet add pictureth first thing youllne resiz fitus corner resiz handl move want worksheet pictur select get thepictur tool format tabim go click crop andthen crop part wallso look better pageth insert tab also hassom new tool might check likescreenshot spark lineson page layout tab youhav command work withth setup pagesand align elementsy also select athem workbookwhich appli professionallook set font color everyth select one likey use chartopt choos want toappli themecolor chartsth formula tab whereyoul find function libraryand formularel commandsfor exampl click hereto show formulaslet add column thisdata add formulathat add data theother column could writea formula manual whydo insertan auto sum functionclick sum excel add function auto completesth argument formula youpress enternow take one step drag thislittl green handl autofillth formula cellsth data tab commandsfor work datafor exampl connect toextern data sourc command click toaccess data connect wizardth review tab spell checker command add review commentsand final view tabha command option forchang view worksheet exampl remov grid linesclick freez pane keep header row column scrollingon thing may beinterest header footersy get click page layout view click herey excel let work worksheet theyappear print pageaft youv ad andformat data insert chart pivott time save printexport share workbook
"Save, publish, and share","After you finish yourworkbook, Excel has many optionsfor saving, printing,exporting and sharing it, and you'll find all thoseoptions here in the backstage, like Save as.Typically you savea file to your computer, but you could also save aworkbook to an online service like Office 365 SharePoint and OneDrive.I've already logged on tomy account in Excel, so now I can save the workbook to my OneDrive the same way I'd save it to my computer, only now I can access it from any computer connected to the Internet, click share after you save a workbook if youwant to share it with others.Or you can export it in a numberof other file types such as PDF.Now you have a pretty goodidea of what's involved inmaking the switch fromExcel 2003 to the new Excel.There's just one morething you should know and it's about compatibility. In the second video we converted an Excel 2003 xls file to the new xslx format,the two formats aredifferent but in most cases you'll only run into a problemwhen you want to share your workbook with someonewho uses Excel 2003.If that's the case you have two options: the first option is to save the file in the olderxls format, here's how to do that.First go to the backstage,with Info selected here, click Check for issues and thenrun the compatibility checker,the compatibility checkerchecks to see if there will beany problems whensaving in the older format.Take a look at the results and modify the workbook if you feel that's necessary. Finally click Save as,choose a location,and then in the save as dialog box change the save as type to Excel 97 to 2003. Now the person you're sharing the file with can open the workbook in the older version of Excel.The second option for theperson using Excel 2003 is todownload an add-incalled the compatibility pack.So that's it, you shouldhave all the information you need to make theswitch to the new Excel.Of course there isalways more to learn.",finish yourworkbook excel mani optionsfor save printingexport share youll find thoseopt backstag like save astyp savea file comput could also save aworkbook onlin servic like offic 365 sharepoint onedriv alreadi log tomi account excel save workbook onedr way id save comput access comput connect internet click share save workbook youwant share othersor export numberof file type pdfnow pretti goodidea what involv inmak switch fromexcel 2003 new excelther one moreth know compat second video convert excel 2003 xl file new xslx formatth two format arediffer case youll run problemwhen want share workbook someonewho use excel 2003if that case two option first option save file olderxl format here thatfirst go backstagewith info select click check issu thenrun compat checkerth compat checkercheck see beani problem whensav older formattak look result modifi workbook feel that necessari final click save aschoos locationand save dialog box chang save type excel 97 2003 person your share file open workbook older version excelth second option theperson use excel 2003 todownload addincal compat packso that shouldhav inform need make theswitch new excelof cours isalway learn
Sort and filter data,"Excel is an amazingtool for analyzing data;and Sort and Filter are some of the mostcommonly used features to help you do this.To change the order of yourdata, you want to sort it.Right click a cell in the columnyou want to sort, and point to Sort.Since the cells in thiscolumn contain only numbers,the sort options are:Sort smallest to largest,and Sort largest to smallest.Most number formats, such as timeand currency, have these sort options.I click Sort smallest to largest, and the codes are sorted from lowest to highest value.To focus on a specific set of your data,you can filter a range of cells or a table.Click any cell in the range or table,on the Home tab, clickSort and filter, and click filter.Click a dropdown arrow atthe top of one of the columns,to display its filter options.I click the dropdownarrow in the Category column.Since the column contains text,I get the text filter options.I can also uncheck and check values.I uncheck All values,select Fruit, and click OKand only the rows that have Fruitin the category column are displayed.",excel amazingtool analyz dataand sort filter mostcommonli use featur help thisto chang order yourdata want sort itright click cell columny want sort point sortsinc cell thiscolumn contain numbersth sort option aresort smallest largestand sort largest smallestmost number format timeand currenc sort optionsi click sort smallest largest code sort lowest highest valueto focu specif set datay filter rang cell tableclick cell rang tableon home tab clicksort filter click filterclick dropdown arrow atth top one columnsto display filter optionsi click dropdownarrow categori columnsinc column contain texti get text filter optionsi also uncheck check valuesi uncheck valuesselect fruit click okand row fruitin categori column display
Sort details,"We sorted numbers in theprevious video;you can also sort text and dates;either alphabetically, by format,such as color, or by acustom list you create.To sort a range or table using text,right click a cell in a column that contains text,point to Sort, and click A to Z or Z to A,and the range sorts alphabetically.To sort a range or table using dates,right click a cell in acolumn that contains dates,point to Sort, and clickSort oldest to newestor Sort newest to oldest,and the range sorts chronologically.For more advanced sorting,such as sorting by multiple columns,click any cell inthe range or table,click the Data tab, and click Sort.In the sort dialog,there is an option to the right:My data has headers.A column header, is a row at the top of a range of cells or a table,that contains names for the columns.It's a good idea to have them.Without headers you sortby column A, B, C and so on,but it can be hard to rememberwhich columns contain what data.With headers you can sortby column names,such as Category andProduct name, in this example.Set sort by theCategory, click Add level,set them by theProduct name, and click OK.And the cells are now sorted alphabetically, by category, and then product name.You can also sort using a custom list you create.You might want to do this,when you want to sortyour text by category,instead of alphabetically.Click Sort, I set sort by the Category,click the order dropdownarrow, and click Custom list.A common reason to not sortalphabetically, is to sort bythe days of the week ormonths of the year;and Excel already providesthese custom lists for you.I'm going to create a custom list that sorts the category column in the order I want.I type a value that's in thecategory column and press Enter.I keep doing this, untilI have completed my list.You can also type or pastea list separated by commas.I click Add, and click OK;I click OK againand the range is sorted bythe category column using the custom list we just created.You may have noticed, that a few of the cells in the discontinued columnhave different cell and font colors.You can sort by these colors.In this sort dialog, Iset Sort by to discontinued,I click the sort on down arrow, in addition to Values,the list has the Cell color,Font color, and Cell icon options.These were commonlyapplied using conditional formatting;although you canformat them manually as well.I click Cell color, I want the cells with No vell Color, to be on top;so I leave it set to the defaults, and click copy level.On the new level, I change order to redand set it to on bottom;I click OK and the range is sorted by cell colors in the discontinued column.You can undo a sort if you haven't saved the workbook since you sorted.I click the undo button onthe Quick Access Toolbar,you can also use thekeyboard shortcut Ctrl-Z.If you've saved theworkbook, you can't undo a sort.So far we've sorted data incolumns, the most common way to sort, but you can also sort by rows.This is the data we'vebeen working with,but the columns, such asCategory, are now rows.To sort by rows, click Sort, notice that the sort dialog is configured to sort by columns, click

Take conditional formatting to the next level,"In the course UseConditional Formatting, we covered the basics of conditional formatting.Conditional formattingprovides visual cues to help you make sense of your data.For example, it'll clearly show highs and lows, or other data trends, based on the criteria you specify.See the course summary at theend of this course for a link.In this course, we will goover how to get that much moreout of conditional formatting. You can apply it to specific cells, tables, pivot tables and worksheets. For example, to quickly conditionally format these selected cells, you can use a quick analysis option, or an option on the conditionalformatting button in the ribbon.But if you want morecontrol over what type, and when conditional formattingapplies, click New rule,select the rule type,such as format all cells based on their values, select a format style,such as icon sets,select the icon style that you want, icons sets range from 3 to 5 icons and numerous icons styles, I'm going to leave it set to the default. For the green icon, I setthe type of value to Number.When I do this, the value is set to zero, overriding the previous value, which is why I do it first.I'll leave the operator setto greater than or equal to,and set the value to 1.For the yellow icon,I set the value to .5and the red icon is automatically set to less than .5.I click OK, and thevalues in the profit column are conditionally formatted bythe new rule we just created,and I can see at a glancethat dried pears, walnuts and cottonseed oil havethe highest profits.You can also format cellsthat are blank or contain errors.This time select Formatonly cells that contain;select Blanks or errors,choose the formatting you want.The options andcombinations are virtually endless.I'm going to fill thecells that contain errors.Click OK.Click OK again, and thiscell with an error is formatted.For information aboutediting and deleting rules, see the final video of this course.Up next: Use formulas toapply conditional formatting.",cours usecondit format cover basic condit formattingcondit formattingprovid visual cue help make sens datafor exampl itll clearli show high low data trend base criteria specifyse cours summari theend cours linkin cours goover get much moreout condit format appli specif cell tabl pivot tabl worksheet exampl quickli condit format select cell use quick analysi option option conditionalformat button ribbonbut want morecontrol type condit formattingappli click new ruleselect rule typesuch format cell base valu select format stylesuch icon setsselect icon style want icon set rang 3 5 icon numer icon style im go leav set default green icon setth type valu numberwhen valu set zero overrid previou valu firstil leav oper setto greater equal toand set valu 1for yellow iconi set valu 5and red icon automat set less 5i click ok thevalu profit column condit format byth new rule createdand see glancethat dri pear walnut cottonse oil haveth highest profitsy also format cellsthat blank contain errorsthi time select formatonli cell containselect blank errorschoos format wantth option andcombin virtual endlessim go fill thecel contain errorsclick okclick ok thiscel error formattedfor inform aboutedit delet rule see final video courseup next use formula toappli condit format
Use formulas to apply conditional formatting,"To control more preciselywhat cells will be formatted,you can use formulas toapply conditional formatting.In this example I'm goingto format the cells in the Product column, If the corresponding cell in In stock column is greater than 300.I select the cells I wantto conditionally format.When you select a range of cells, the first cell you select is the active cell.In this example I selected from B2 through B10, so B2 is the active cell, we'll need to know that shortly. Create a New rule; select Use a formula to determine which cells to format.Since B2 is theactive cell, I type =E2>300.I used the relative cellreference E2 to makesure the formula adjusts to correctly format theother cells in column B.I click the Format button andchoose how I want to format the cells.I'm going to use a blue fill; click OK to accept the color, clickOK again to apply the format.And the cells in the Product column, where the corresponding cell incolumn E is greater than 300are conditionally formatted.When I change a value incolumn E to greater than 300,the conditional formatting in theProduct column automatically applies.You can create multiple rulesthat apply to the same cells.In this example I wantdifferent fill colorsfor different ranges of scores.I select the cells I wantto apply a rule to;create a new rule that uses the rule type use of formula to determinewhich cells to format.I want to format a cell if itsvalue is greater than, or equal to 90.The active cell is B2, soI enter the formula =B2>=90,and configure the rule toapply a green fill when the formula is true for a cell,and the cell that has a value greater than, or equal to, 90 is filled with green.I created another rule forthe same cells, but this timeI want to format a cell ifits value is greater than, orequal to 80, and less than 90.The formula is =AND(B2>=80;B2<90)and I choose a different fill color.I create similar rules for 70 and 60.The last rule is forvalues less than 60.The cells are now arainbow of colors,and these are the rules wejust created to enable this.Up next: Manageconditional formatting.",control preciselywhat cell formattedy use formula toappli condit formattingin exampl im goingto format cell product column correspond cell stock column greater 300i select cell wantto condit formatwhen select rang cell first cell select activ cellin exampl select b2 b10 b2 activ cell well need know shortli creat new rule select use formula determin cell formatsinc b2 theactiv cell type e2300i use rel cellrefer e2 makesur formula adjust correctli format theother cell column bi click format button andchoos want format cellsim go use blue fill click ok accept color clickok appli formatand cell product column correspond cell incolumn e greater 300are condit formattedwhen chang valu incolumn e greater 300the condit format theproduct column automat appliesy creat multipl rulesthat appli cellsin exampl wantdiffer fill colorsfor differ rang scoresi select cell wantto appli rule tocreat new rule use rule type use formula determinewhich cell formati want format cell itsvalu greater equal 90the activ cell b2 soi enter formula b290and configur rule toappli green fill formula true celland cell valu greater equal 90 fill greeni creat anoth rule forth cell timei want format cell ifit valu greater orequ 80 less 90the formula andb280b290and choos differ fill colori creat similar rule 70 60the last rule forvalu less 60the cell arainbow colorsand rule wejust creat enabl thisup next managecondit format
Manage conditional formatting,"In the conditionalformatting rules manager, you can choose to show formattingrules for areas of a workbook that have rules, such as the current selection,or a specific worksheet.you can then create, editand delete rules as wellas manage the precedence of rules for the cells orworksheet you selected,when conflicting rulesapply to cells, the rule withhigher precedence wins, by default the most recently created rule is at the top of the list and has precedence overpreviously created rules.For example in cells B2 through B10, I've already created two rules. The firstrule I created is ifthe cell value is greater than 70,000, make the fill color yellow.The next rule I created andtherefore the one with the precedence, is if the cellvalue was greater than 60,000make the fill color blue.In cell B2 for examplethe value is greater than 70,000.But the value isalso greater than 60,000,so the cell wasformatted with the blue fill.The way the rules arecurrently ordered, cells that are greater than 70 thousand,which are always going to begreater than 60 thousandtoo, are formatted with the blue fill, the 60,000 rule has precedence over the 70,000 rule. If we change the order of the rules, thereby changing the precedence, cells that are greater than 70,000are formatted with the yellow fill and cells that aregreater than 60,000 but lessthan 70,000 areformatted with the blue fill.To see which cells of aworksheet have conditionalformatting rules, possibly to investigate why they aren't working as you expect,click the find and select button on the Home tab and then click conditional formattingthe cells that have conditionalformatting rules are selected.In this example there aretwo rules, one applies to cellsthat contain errors and theother to cells that contain blank values, neither caseexists on the worksheet, which is why you don't see conditionalformatting but the rules were there.Another way to manageconditional formatting is to sortand filter based on thecolors you apply.To sort a worksheet based onconditional formatting, select the cells you want to sort,click the sort and filter button on the Home tab.The sort and filter group on the Datatab provide similarfunctionality, click Custom sort.In this example, theprofit column has icons that aregreen yellow and red circles.for sort on, I select cell icon, I want the green icons at the top, I copy the sort rule and change it to the red icon and set it to on bottom, I click OK and the worksheet is sorted by conditional formatting.To filter a worksheet basedon conditional formatting,select the cells you wantto filter, click sort and filter, click filter, click thefilter down arrow for acolumn, click filter by color,I want the red icons toremain visible so I click it,and only the rows with red iconsin the profit column are displayed.Now you've got a pretty goodidea about how to take fulladvantage of conditional formatting.Of course there'salways more to learn.",conditionalformat rule manag choos show formattingrul area workbook rule current selectionor specif worksheety creat editand delet rule wella manag preced rule cell orworksheet selectedwhen conflict rulesappli cell rule withhigh preced win default recent creat rule top list preced overprevi creat rulesfor exampl cell b2 b10 ive alreadi creat two rule firstrul creat ifth cell valu greater 70000 make fill color yellowth next rule creat andtherefor one preced cellvalu greater 60000make fill color bluein cell b2 exampleth valu greater 70000but valu isalso greater 60000so cell wasformat blue fillth way rule arecurr order cell greater 70 thousandwhich alway go begreat 60 thousandtoo format blue fill 60000 rule preced 70000 rule chang order rule therebi chang preced cell greater 70000are format yellow fill cell aregreat 60000 lessthan 70000 areformat blue fillto see cell aworksheet conditionalformat rule possibl investig arent work expectclick find select button home tab click condit formattingth cell conditionalformat rule selectedin exampl aretwo rule one appli cellsthat contain error theother cell contain blank valu neither caseexist worksheet dont see conditionalformat rule thereanoth way managecondit format sortand filter base thecolor applyto sort worksheet base oncondit format select cell want sortclick sort filter button home tabth sort filter group datatab provid similarfunction click custom sortin exampl theprofit column icon aregreen yellow red circlesfor sort select cell icon want green icon top copi sort rule chang red icon set bottom click ok worksheet sort condit formattingto filter worksheet basedon condit formattingselect cell wantto filter click sort filter click filter click thefilt arrow acolumn click filter colori want red icon toremain visibl click itand row red iconsin profit column displayednow youv got pretti goodidea take fulladvantag condit formattingof cours theresalway learn

VLOOKUP: How and when to use it,"When you need to findinformation in a large spreadsheet,or you're always looking for the same kind of information, use theVLOOKUP function.VLOOKUP works a lot like aphone book, where you startwith a piece of data youknow, someone's name, in orderto find out what you don'tknow: their phone number.So as an example, I'llenter part numbers, the thing I know, and find outprices, the thing I don't know.To do that, I'll click the cellwhere I want to see the prices.I'll enter an =, VLOOKUP, and ().These parentheses willcontain a set of arguments, and an argument is just a piece of datathat the function needs in order to run.I'll enter H2 as the firstargument, because that's where I'll type the part numbers. Follow that with a comma, and then I'll enter the range of cells that contains the data I want to search;that's this block of data here.The part numbers start in cell B3.And if I scroll down, youcan see the status values end at cell E52; so I'll enter B3:E52.Then I'll type another comma.And you need to do thatbecause the functions won't workwithout the colons and commas.Next, I'll type the number 3.This tells VLOOKUP thatthe values I want to see are inthe third column from the left inthe range of cells I want to search.In other words, it's thethird column over from the part numbers, the data I know.Another comma, and I enterFalse, because that gives mean exact match between partnumber and price, and don't worry, I'll explainhow that works later.When I press enter to tellExcel I'm done, you can see I get an error message because Ihaven't entered a value in cell H2.But when I enter a partnumber, I get a price.So what just happened?I told Excel: here's a value inthe left hand column of my data.Now look through this rangeof cells and, in the thirdcolumn to the right, findthe value on the same row.A lot like a phone book.So up next, I'll explaineach of the arguments, the values inside the parentheses,along with rules for using VLOOKUP.",need findinform larg spreadsheetor your alway look kind inform use thevlookup functionvlookup work lot like aphon book startwith piec data youknow someon name orderto find dontknow phone numberso exampl illent part number thing know find outpric thing dont knowto ill click cellwher want see pricesil enter vlookup parenthes willcontain set argument argument piec datathat function need order runil enter h2 firstargu that ill type part number follow comma ill enter rang cell contain data want searchthat block data hereth part number start cell b3and scroll youcan see statu valu end cell e52 ill enter b3e52then ill type anoth commaand need thatbecaus function wont workwithout colon commasnext ill type number 3thi tell vlookup thatth valu want see inth third column left inth rang cell want searchin word thethird column part number data knowanoth comma enterfals give mean exact match partnumb price dont worri ill explainhow work laterwhen press enter tellexcel im done see get error messag ihav enter valu cell h2but enter partnumb get priceso happenedi told excel here valu inth left hand column datanow look rangeof cell thirdcolumn right findth valu rowa lot like phone bookso next ill explaineach argument valu insid parenthesesalong rule use vlookup
The nuts and bolts of VLOOKUP,"The previous video showed you oneway to use the VLOOKUP function.Now let's break thatexample down and see how it works.VLOOKUP uses fourarguments, or pieces of data.The first argument is calledthe Look up value, and it's the data you know; if I were using a phone book, the Look up value would be someone's name.In this example thoughthe Look up values are part numbers, and I'm using a cell reference as a placeholder for those part numbers.If you wanted to,could also enter the valuesdirectly in the formula; like so.But as a rule it's easierto enter values in cells thanin formulas, sothat's what I did here.The next argument is the blockof values that you want to search.Excel calls this the Tablearray, or the Look up table,and our example usescells B3 through E52.You can use any cell rangethat you think will return the data you need to find, butyou need to remember a gotcha.The Look up values, the datayou know, have to be in the left hand column of yourLook up table; your cell range.You can have data to theleft of your Look up values, but VLOOKUP won't search there.The next argument, thenumber 3, is a column reference;it tells VLOOKUP where youexpect to find the data you want to see.We're using column D; thethird column over from the Look up values, so I entered 3.And this also points toanother gotcha: your data has to be arranged in columns vertically.Just remember that the Vin VLOOKUP stands for""vertical"", and columns are vertical.The last argument iscalled the Range look up, and it tells the function that Iwant an exact match, or a partial match, to my look up value.I'm using False to give meexact matches; I entered a part number; I got a price.But sometimes you onlywant a partial match.For example, this Exceltable calculates discounts, andit assumes customers don't want tobuy exactly 10 or 100 of anything.In other words, I don'twant to limit them to findingmatches to just thevalues in this column.So I enter the number of itemspurchased, and I get a discount of 9%.If you look at the arguments for the function, you cansee it uses True instead of False.That lets me enter quantities that don't match the values listed in the table. So another gotcha to remember: False returns exact matches;True returns partial matches.Also if you want to use True youcan just leave the argument blank.So that's how VLOOKUPworks, and next I'll show you howto use it to find dataon a different worksheet.",previou video show oneway use vlookup functionnow let break thatexampl see worksvlookup use fourargu piec datath first argument calledth look valu data know use phone book look valu would someon namein exampl thoughth look valu part number im use cell refer placehold part numbersif want tocould also enter valuesdirectli formula like sobut rule easierto enter valu cell thanin formula sothat hereth next argument blockof valu want searchexcel call tablearray look tableand exampl usescel b3 e52you use cell rangethat think return data need find butyou need rememb gotchath look valu datay know left hand column yourlook tabl cell rangey data theleft look valu vlookup wont search thereth next argument thenumb 3 column referenceit tell vlookup youexpect find data want seewer use column thethird column look valu enter 3and also point toanoth gotcha data arrang column verticallyjust rememb vin vlookup stand forvert column verticalth last argument iscal rang look tell function iwant exact match partial match look valueim use fals give meexact match enter part number got pricebut sometim onlyw partial matchfor exampl excelt calcul discount andit assum custom dont want tobuy exactli 10 100 anythingin word dontwant limit findingmatch thevalu columnso enter number itemspurchas get discount 9if look argument function canse use true instead falsethat let enter quantiti dont match valu list tabl anoth gotcha rememb fals return exact matchestru return partial matchesalso want use true youcan leav argument blankso that vlookupwork next ill show howto use find dataon differ worksheet
Look up values on a different worksheet,"If you need to, you canlook up values on more than oneworksheet in a workbook.As an example, we downloaded some web site data from a database, and the first sheet has page numbers for the site pages, and the hits on each page.The second sheet also has thepage numbers, plus the page names.VLOOKUP can help meaggregate this data so I can seepage IDs, names andhits in one place.I'll start here on the pagestab because it gives me twoof the function's arguments.First, I see the page names arelisted in column B, the second column over.This is what I want VLOOKUP to find, the answers I wantto see, so my columnreference argument is 2.Also, I know I want to find the pagename that matches a given page number.That data starts in CellA2 an ends in cell B39,so A2 to B39 is mylook up table argument.Now I'll go to the pageviews tab, enter a couple of headings, and my function, =VLOOKUP,open parentheses, and F2 is my look up value because that's where I'll enter the page IDs.Next I enter pages, thename of the other tab, an exclamation point,then my look up table, a comma, and my column reference.In other words, thelook-up table argument is now the name of the worksheet, theexclamation point, and the range of cells I want to search.Because I need exactmatches, I'll enter False as my range look up argument,press Enter to finish the formula; and you can see Iget an error message becausethe formula wants a value in cell F2.So I'll copy a page ID here,paste it, and now I know how many hits NationalPage News 2 received; and to do this again, press Escapeto clear the marquee, copy another page number, paste it;and you'll see another page name.So next, I'll show youhow to use absolute cellreferences in VLOOKUP formulas; they are how you copythe formula down a column.",need canlook valu oneworksheet workbooka exampl download web site data databas first sheet page number site page hit pageth second sheet also thepag number plu page namesvlookup help meaggreg data seepag id name andhit one placeil start pagestab give twoof function argumentsfirst see page name arelist column b second column overthi want vlookup find answer wantto see columnrefer argument 2also know want find pagenam match given page numberthat data start cella2 end cell b39so a2 b39 mylook tabl argumentnow ill go pageview tab enter coupl head function vlookupopen parenthes f2 look valu that ill enter page idsnext enter page thenam tab exclam pointthen look tabl comma column referencein word thelookup tabl argument name worksheet theexclam point rang cell want searchbecaus need exactmatch ill enter fals rang look argumentpress enter finish formula see iget error messag becauseth formula want valu cell f2so ill copi page id herepast know mani hit nationalpag news 2 receiv press escapeto clear marque copi anoth page number past itand youll see anoth page nameso next ill show youhow use absolut cellrefer vlookup formula copyth formula column
Copy a VLOOKUP formula,"Whenever you need to copya VLOOKUP formula, or anyother formula, you have touse absolute cell references.For example, it would benice to list all the page namesnext to their page numbersand hit data, instead of justlooking them up one at a time.To do that, we will need tocopy the formula down this column.Whenever you copy a formulayou have to use absolute cellreferences, and you do that byadding dollar signs to your arguments.So I'll demonstrate byadding a heading, and then I'll start the formula. but this time, instead of entering a blank cell as my first argument,my look-up value, I'll enter $A4.The dollar sign is what makesit an absolute cell reference.In this case it forces VLOOKUPto use just the values in column A.I'm using those because Iknow I want to match each pagenumber with its pagename, so I'll use those valuesdirectly instead of theempty placeholder cells you'veseen in the previous videos.Next I enter the name ofthe other worksheet, an exclamation point, then in my cell range, I also use two more dollar signs in front of the A and the B, like so.I'll enter the same columnreference argument: 2, and False is my range look up argument, again because I want exact matches.Press Enter, and theformula returns Home page.Now grab the fill handle;drag it down the column;and there you go: allthe data, easy to scan.One thing to rememberthough: I only used dollar signs infront of the column letters.If I separate column lettersand row numbers with dollar signs, like this, VLOOKUP only returns one value: the first one. That happens because dollar signs prevent Excelfrom changing column and row values in a formula when you copy that formula.Now here's something that can help: if you're having trouble adding dollar signsto a formula, put your cursorin an argument and press F4; as you press the button it inserts dollar signs in eachallowable place in the argument.In other words, it won't letyou put one in the wrong place.Just press F4 until thedollar sign is in the right placeand go on to your next argument.So that's a final gotcha,and while we're talking about them, let's recap theother possible mistakes: your look up table has to be tothe right of your look upvalues, or on another worksheet.You have to arrangeyour data in columns,and you enter False whenyou want an exact match, andTrue, or nothing, ifyou want a partial match.Finally, if you're going tocopy the formula, make sureyou put the dollarsigns in the right places.",whenev need copya vlookup formula anyoth formula tous absolut cell referencesfor exampl would benic list page namesnext page numbersand hit data instead justlook one timeto need tocopi formula columnwhenev copi formulay use absolut cellrefer byad dollar sign argumentsso ill demonstr byad head ill start formula time instead enter blank cell first argumentmi lookup valu ill enter a4th dollar sign makesit absolut cell referencein case forc vlookupto use valu column aim use iknow want match pagenumb pagenam ill use valuesdirectli instead theempti placehold cell youveseen previou videosnext enter name ofth worksheet exclam point cell rang also use two dollar sign front b like soill enter columnrefer argument 2 fals rang look argument want exact matchespress enter theformula return home pagenow grab fill handledrag columnand go allth data easi scanon thing rememberthough use dollar sign infront column lettersif separ column lettersand row number dollar sign like vlookup return one valu first one happen dollar sign prevent excelfrom chang column row valu formula copi formulanow here someth help your troubl ad dollar signsto formula put cursorin argument press f4 press button insert dollar sign eachallow place argumentin word wont letyou put one wrong placejust press f4 thedollar sign right placeand go next argumentso that final gotchaand talk let recap theother possibl mistak look tabl toth right look upvalu anoth worksheety arrangeyour data columnsand enter fals whenyou want exact match andtru noth ifyou want partial matchfin your go tocopi formula make surey put dollarsign right place
Advanced IF functions,"We'll cover complexexamples and variations of the IF function in a few minutes.But first a quick IF function refresher:I'm determining if my travelexpenses are over, or within budget.If the actual expense isgreater than the budgeted expense,statuts is over budget.Otherwise,it's within budget.In the formula, text, like ""Over Budget"" and ""Within Budget"" must be in quotes.And now I'm copying the formula.Now I'm determining if acategory of merchandise requiresa shipping surcharge.If packaging is equal to Fragile,comparing text with the IF function is not case sensitive,the surcharge is $75.Otherwise it's zero.I'm copying the formula again.If the text has extra spaces,comparing text with the function may not returnthe results we expect.The text in B3 has aleading space,and it's not returning the results I expect.It should have a $75surcharge because it's fragile.Getting this wrong would take$75 per mistake out of our revenue.Adding the trim function tothe formula will help;the trim function removesspaces from a text string,except for single spaces between words;and now the formula handlesextra spaces in text strings.This is the syntax orgrammar of the IF function.Logical tests as required.It can be any expressionthat can be evaluated to True or False,like comparingone number or cell to another,such as C2 greater than B2.It can also be text,such as B2 equal to Fragile.value_if_true is optional.This is the value if thelogical test evaluates to True.For example,if C2 greater than B2 is true,return ""over budget"".If the logical testevaluates to true,and we don't provide the value for value_if_true, the function returns zero.Value if false is also optional.This is the value if thelogical test evaluates to False.For example,if C2 greater than B2 is false,return ""within budget"".If the logical testevaluates to false,and we don't provide the value for value_if_false false, the function returns zero.Up next:nested IF functions.",well cover complexexampl variat function minutesbut first quick function refresherim determin travelexpens within budgetif actual expens isgreat budget expensestatut budgetotherwiseit within budgetin formula text like budget within budget must quotesand im copi formulanow im determin acategori merchandis requiresa ship surchargeif packag equal fragilecompar text function case sensitiveth surcharg 75otherwis zeroim copi formula againif text extra spacescompar text function may returnth result expectth text b3 alead spaceand return result expectit 75surcharg fragileget wrong would take75 per mistak revenuead trim function toth formula helpth trim function removesspac text stringexcept singl space wordsand formula handlesextra space text stringsthi syntax orgrammar functionlog test requiredit expressionthat evalu true falselik comparingon number cell anothersuch c2 greater b2it also textsuch b2 equal fragilevalue_if_tru optionalthi valu thelog test evalu truefor exampleif c2 greater b2 truereturn budgetif logic testevalu trueand dont provid valu value_if_tru function return zerovalu fals also optionalthi valu thelog test evalu falsefor exampleif c2 greater b2 falsereturn within budgetif logic testevalu falseand dont provid valu value_if_fals fals function return zeroup nextnest function
Nested IF functions,"One IF function has onetest and two possible outcomes:True or false.Nested IF functions, meaning one IF function inside of another,allows you to test multiple criteria and increase the number of possible outcomes.We want to determine astudent's grade based on their score.If Bob's score in B2 is >=90,return an A.We nest an IF function bysetting Value if false toIF B2 >=80, return B.we use additional nested IFfunctions to test for C, D and F grades.I'm copying the formula.In this formula,we must test B2 >=90 firstand then B2 >= 80,and so on.Let me show you why:If B2 >= 90 evaluates to true,the formula returns A and we're done.If it's false,B2 >= 80 is evaluated;since B2 >= 90has already been evaluated to false,greater than or equal to 80 is essentiallygreater than or equal to 80 and less than 90.This continues forgreater than or equal to 70 and 60.F is thefinal value of false.Here's another example:I want to determine commissionsfor our sales staff,but the commission percentage variesdepending on how much they've sold.If Bob's sales,B2 >= to 10,000,the cursor isnext to the cell reference.I'm pressing F4 to make itan absolute cell reference,the commission is 5%.I'm pressing F4 again.If Bob's sales are >= 5,000,his commission is 2%,otherwise his commission is zero.We then multiply theresult by his sales.This is another example wherethe order of the formula matters.Sales greater than orequal to 10,000 is tested first.If it evaluates to True,it returns a value in G2: 5%.If it evaluates to False, sales greater than or equal to 5,000 is evaluated next.Since 10000 has alreadybeen evaluated as false,sales greater than or equal to5,000 is essentially,greater than or equal to5,000 and less than 10,000.If neither are greater thanor equal to 10,000,or greater thanor equal to 5,000 is true,the function returns a value in G4: zero.Up next: IF with AND and OR functions.",one function onetest two possibl outcomestru falsenest function mean one function insid anotherallow test multipl criteria increas number possibl outcomesw want determin astud grade base scoreif bob score b2 90return awe nest function byset valu fals toif b2 80 return bwe use addit nest iffunct test c f gradesim copi formulain formulaw must test b2 90 firstand b2 80and onlet show whyif b2 90 evalu trueth formula return doneif falseb2 80 evaluatedsinc b2 90ha alreadi evalu falsegreat equal 80 essentiallygreat equal 80 less 90thi continu forgreat equal 70 60f thefin valu falseher anoth examplei want determin commissionsfor sale staffbut commiss percentag variesdepend much theyv soldif bob salesb2 10000the cursor isnext cell referenceim press f4 make itan absolut cell referenceth commiss 5im press f4 againif bob sale 5000hi commiss 2otherwis commiss zerow multipli theresult salesthi anoth exampl whereth order formula matterssal greater orequ 10000 test firstif evalu trueit return valu g2 5if evalu fals sale greater equal 5000 evalu nextsinc 10000 alreadybeen evalu falsesal greater equal to5000 essentiallygreat equal to5000 less 10000if neither greater thanor equal 10000or greater thanor equal 5000 trueth function return valu g4 zeroup next function
IF with AND and OR,"Now we will extend thefunctionality of the IF functionby nesting AND and OR functions.We're looking for studentswho have all As on their tests,using IF witha nested AND function.The formula will test to seeif all the conditions are true.If so, the result ofthe IF function is TRUE.For always, we need to know ifa student's score on Test 1 is >= 90.The cursor is nextto the cell reference.I'm pressing F4 to make itan absolute cell reference.And their score on Test 2 is >= 90,I'm pressing F4 again,and their score on Test 3 is >=90.If they're all >=90,the IF function returns YES;if not, it returns NO.I'm copying the formula.We can see that only Mo has ''All A's''.Let's take a look at howthat worked:AND returns TRUE when allarguments evaluate to true,and FALSE when at least oneargument evaluates to false.For the IF function, whenthe logical test evaluates to true,the IF functionreturns value of TRUE;when logical test evaluates to false,the function returns a value of FALSE.AND is nested in the IFfunction, and is the logical test.When all arguments in theAND function evaluate to true,IF returns the value of TRUE;When at least one argument in the AND functionevaluates to false,IF returns the value of FALSE.Now we're looking forstudents who have at least one A ontheir tests, using IFwith a nested OR function.For at least one A, we needto know if a student's scoreon Test 1 is >= 90,or their score on Test 2 is >= 90,or their score on Test 3 is >= 90.If at least one test is >= 90,the IF function returns YES.If none of the tests are >= 90,it returns NO.Both Bob and Mo have at least one A.Let's look at how that worked: it'ssimilar to the nested AND function.OR returns TRUE if anyargument is true,and FALSE when all arguments are false.In this example, OR is nested in theIF function, and is the logical test.If any argument in the ORfunction evaluates to true,IF returns a value of TRUE.If all arguments in thefunction evaluate to false,IF returns a value of FALSE.Up next: the COUNTIFSand SUMIFS functions.",extend thefunction functionbi nest functionswer look studentswho testsus witha nest functionth formula test seeif condit trueif result ofth function truefor alway need know ifa student score test 1 90the cursor nextto cell referenceim press f4 make itan absolut cell referenceand score test 2 90im press f4 againand score test 3 90if theyr 90the function return yesif return noim copi formulaw see mo aslet take look howthat workedand return true allargu evalu trueand fals least oneargu evalu falsefor function whenth logic test evalu trueth functionreturn valu truewhen logic test evalu falseth function return valu falseand nest iffunct logic testwhen argument theand function evalu trueif return valu truewhen least one argument functionevalu falseif return valu falsenow look forstud least one ontheir test use ifwith nest functionfor least one needto know student scoreon test 1 90or score test 2 90or score test 3 90if least one test 90the function return yesif none test 90it return noboth bob mo least one alet look work itssimilar nest functionor return true anyargu trueand fals argument falsein exampl nest theif function logic testif argument orfunct evalu trueif return valu trueif argument thefunct evalu falseif return valu falseup next countifsand sumif function
COUNTIFS and SUMIFS,"To determine the number ofsales people, by region,who have 50 or more orders,we use the COUNTIFS function.First we select theregion cell range and I press F4 to make this anabsolute cell reference,Then we select the criteria itneeds to meet, in this case the region is east, then we select the cell range for the number of orders and the criteria it needs to meet,greater than orequal to 50 in cell G2,I'm using a cell referencefor the criteria instead of hard coding it into the formula, so that I can easily change it if I want to.In the East region there isone person with 50 or more orders.Let's walk through this.First the function evaluateshow many cells in the region cell range B2 throughB7 are equal to East,in this example thereare two: Bob and Sue.Of these two it thenevaluates how many have ordersgreater than or equal to 50, cell G2.In this case it's just Bob.COUNTIFS supplies criteriato cells across multiple ranges, and counts the numberof times all criteria are met.This is the syntax ofthe COUNTIFS function.Criteria range 1 is required,it's the first range that's evaluated.Criteria 1 is required,It's the criteria by whichcriteria range 1 is evaluated.Criteria range 2,criteria 2, and so on are optional.Each additionalrange must have the same number of rows and columnsas criteria range 1 but they don't have to beadjacent to each other.You can use the question mark andasterisk wildcard characters in criteria.Now we want to determinethe sales by region, where the salesperson has 50 or more orders.We can do this withthe SUMIFS function.First we select the rangeof cells we want to add,In this case the range of cellsin the sales column, I press F4 to make this anabsolute cell reference,Next we select the first cell rangewe want to evaluate,the 4 regions in the region's column. Then, we select the criteria that the range will be evaluated by,In this case East cell F-2, then we select the range of the cells for the number of orders and the criteria, greater than orequal to 50 in cell G2.In the East region, thetotal sales by sales reps withorders greater than orequal to 50 is $49,017.Let's walk through this,it's similar to the COUNTIFS function.First the function evaluateshow many cells in the regioncolumns range ofcells are equal to East,there are two, Bob and Sueare the salespeople for the East Region.Of these two, it then evaluates how many have ordersgreater than or equal to 50.For East it's just Bob.Lastly the function addsthe cells from the range ofcells in the cells columnwhere all the correspondent criteria are met: Bob is the only salesperson from the East region to meet all of the criteria.So the results of thefunction is Bob sales figure.SUMIFS adds the cells in arange that meet multiple criteria.This is the syntax of theSUMIFS function, some range is required, it's one or more cells to sum, blank and text values are ignored, criteria range 1 is required, it's the firstrange that's evaluated,criteria 1 is required,it's the criteria by whichcriteria range 1 isevaluated, criteria range 2, criteria 2 and soon are optional.Each cell in the sum rangeargument is summed only if all the corresponding criteriaspecified are true for that cell,each criteria range argumentmust contain the same numberof rows and columns asthe sum range argument.You can use the question mark andasterisk wildcard characters in criteria.Up next: the AVERAGEIFS and IFERROR functions.",determin number ofsal peopl regionwho 50 ordersw use countif functionfirst select theregion cell rang press f4 make anabsolut cell referencethen select criteria itne meet case region east select cell rang number order criteria need meetgreat orequ 50 cell g2im use cell referencefor criteria instead hard code formula easili chang want toin east region ison person 50 orderslet walk thisfirst function evaluateshow mani cell region cell rang b2 throughb7 equal eastin exampl therear two bob sueof two thenevalu mani ordersgreat equal 50 cell g2in case bobcountif suppli criteriato cell across multipl rang count numberof time criteria metthi syntax ofth countif functioncriteria rang 1 requiredit first rang that evaluatedcriteria 1 requiredit criteria whichcriteria rang 1 evaluatedcriteria rang 2criteria 2 optionaleach additionalrang must number row columnsa criteria rang 1 dont beadjac othery use question mark andasterisk wildcard charact criterianow want determineth sale region salesperson 50 ordersw withth sumif functionfirst select rangeof cell want addin case rang cellsin sale column press f4 make anabsolut cell referencenext select first cell rangew want evaluateth 4 region region column select criteria rang evalu byin case east cell f2 select rang cell number order criteria greater orequ 50 cell g2in east region thetot sale sale rep withord greater orequ 50 49017let walk thisit similar countif functionfirst function evaluateshow mani cell regioncolumn rang ofcel equal eastther two bob suear salespeopl east regionof two evalu mani ordersgreat equal 50for east boblastli function addsth cell rang ofcel cell columnwher correspond criteria met bob salesperson east region meet criteriaso result thefunct bob sale figuresumif add cell arang meet multipl criteriathi syntax thesumif function rang requir one cell sum blank text valu ignor criteria rang 1 requir firstrang that evaluatedcriteria 1 requiredit criteria whichcriteria rang 1 isevalu criteria rang 2 criteria 2 soon optionaleach cell sum rangeargu sum correspond criteriaspecifi true celleach criteria rang argumentmust contain numberof row column asth sum rang argumenty use question mark andasterisk wildcard charact criteriaup next averageif iferror function
AVERAGEIFS and IFERROR,"Now we will determine theaverage sales by region, where the sales personhas 50 or more orders.We can do this withthe AVERAGEIFS function.First we select the rangeof cells we want to average.In this case cells D2through D7 in the sales column.I'm pressing F4 to make thisan absolute cell reference.Next we'll select thefirst range of cells we want to evaluate; the range ofcells in the Region column.Then we select thecriteria by which the range is evaluated, in this case, East, cell F2;then we select the rangeof cells for the number of orders, and the criteria it needs to meet.In the North region, forsales people having 50 or more orders, their average sales are $63,370.Let's walk through this;it's similar to the SUMIFS function: first the function evaluates how many cells in the region columncontain a specific region.In this example: North.There are two: Mo and Dave are thesalespeople for the North region.Of these two, SUMIFS thenevaluates how many have ordersgreater than or equal to 50.For North, this is both Mo and Dave.Lastly, the functionaverages the cells from the range ofcells in the sales column, where allthe corresponding criteria are met.The average of Mo andDave's sales is $63,370.You'll notice that the average for theSouth region is a divide by zero error.I'll show you why, and howto handle this in a minute.AVERAGEIFS returns the averageof cells that meet multiple criteria.This is the syntax of theAVERAGEIFS function: average range is required, it'sone or more cells to average;blank and text values are ignored.Criteria range 1 is required, it'sthe first range that's evaluated.Criteria 1 is required;it's the criteria by whichCriteria range 1 is evaluated.Criteria range 2; criteria2, and so on, are optional.Each of the cells in theaverage range is used in the average calculation onlyif all the correspondingcriteria specifiedare true for that cell.All criteria range must be thesame size and shape as average range.You can use the question mark, anasterisk wildcard characters in criteria.As we saw before, theaverage for the South regionreturns a divide byzero error. Wei is the only salesperson in the south region,and she has fewer than 50 orders.If there are no cells thatmeet all the criteria,AVERAGEIFS returns the divide by zero error.We can enhance the formulawith the IFERROR function tohandle this andother error conditions.I'm putting the AVERAGEIFSfunction inside an IFERROR function.IFERROR returns the valuesspecified, in this case NA,if AVERAGEIFS evaluates to an error.Otherwise it returnsthe result of the formula.And we see that the Southregion no longer returns an error.This is the syntax of theIFERROR function. Value is required.It's the argument thatis checked for an error.Value if error is also required.It's what IFERROR returns if thevalue argument returns an error.Now you've got a pretty good ideaabout how to use IF functions in Excel.Of course there'salways more to learn.",determin theaverag sale region sale personha 50 ordersw withth averageif functionfirst select rangeof cell want averagein case cell d2through d7 sale columnim press f4 make thisan absolut cell referencenext well select thefirst rang cell want evalu rang ofcel region columnthen select thecriteria rang evalu case east cell f2then select rangeof cell number order criteria need meetin north region forsal peopl 50 order averag sale 63370let walk thisit similar sumif function first function evalu mani cell region columncontain specif regionin exampl northther two mo dave thesalespeopl north regionof two sumif thenevalu mani ordersgreat equal 50for north mo davelastli functionaverag cell rang ofcel sale column allth correspond criteria metth averag mo anddav sale 63370youll notic averag thesouth region divid zero erroril show howto handl minuteaverageif return averageof cell meet multipl criteriathi syntax theaverageif function averag rang requir itson cell averageblank text valu ignoredcriteria rang 1 requir itsth first rang that evaluatedcriteria 1 requiredit criteria whichcriteria rang 1 evaluatedcriteria rang 2 criteria2 optionaleach cell theaverag rang use averag calcul onlyif correspondingcriteria specifiedar true cellal criteria rang must thesam size shape averag rangey use question mark anasterisk wildcard charact criteriaa saw theaverag south regionreturn divid byzero error wei salesperson south regionand fewer 50 ordersif cell thatmeet criteriaaverageif return divid zero errorw enhanc formulawith iferror function tohandl andoth error conditionsim put averageifsfunct insid iferror functioniferror return valuesspecifi case naif averageif evalu errorotherwis returnsth result formulaand see southregion longer return errorthi syntax theiferror function valu requiredit argument thati check errorvalu error also requiredit iferror return thevalu argument return errornow youv got pretti good ideaabout use function excelof cours theresalway learn
Start using Excel,"The best way to learn aboutExcel is to start using it.This is what you see when youstart Excel for the first time.You can open an existing workbookover here or start with a template.Since this is our firsttime, let's keep it simple andselect Blank workbook.The area down here is whereyou create your worksheet,and you'll find all thetools you need to work on it uphere in this area called the ribbon.In this area you'll findthe name box and formula bar.You'll see whatthose do as we go along.Now click somewhere in the work area.These little rectangles, called cells, each hold one piece of information: some text, a number or a formula.Let's say we want to create a worksheet to track expenses on an expansion project:type the first budget item and press Enter.There are literally millionsof cells in a worksheet,but each one can be identified usingthis grid system of rows and columns.For example the address ofthis cell is C6: column C, row 6.The name box showswhich cell is selected.You'll see whyaddresses are important later.Next, type the other budget items.This is a breakdown of the workrequired for the expansion project.If the text doesn't fit in the cells, come up here and hold the mouse over the column border until you see a double headed arrow, then, click and drag the border to widen the column.Now, to make your worksheetmore interesting, let's addrough estimates for eachwork item in the next column.To make the numbers look like dollaramounts, we'll add some formatting.First select the numbers byclicking the first number and dragging the mouse down the list; the gray highlighting and green border mean the cells are selected;right click the selection,and the right click menu opens,along with this box up here,called the mini toolbar.The mini toolbar changesdepending on what you select.In this case it containscommands for formatting the cells.Click the dollar sign to formatthe numbers as dollar amounts.Now it's beginning tolook more like a worksheet.To make it official, let'sadd a header row up here, so that anyone who looks to theworksheet will know what the data means in each column.Next, let's do something tothe data to make it easier to work with.Select the header and data; click the top left corner; and drag themouse to the bottom right.This time, instead of rightclicking, just hold the mouseover the selection,and a button appears.Click it, and thequick analysis lens opens.This contains a set of toolsfor helping you analyze your data.Click Tables, andthen click Table.And the data is converted to a table.You don't have to do this, but working with data as a table has certain advantages.For example you can click these arrows to quicklysort or filter the data.You also have a lot of commands and options to choose from up here on the ribbon.For example, we can add a Total row to the table,or remove the banded rows.While we're up here, let'stake a closer look at the ribbon.The commands and options you canwork with are organized into these tabs.Most of the commandsyou'll need are on the Home tab.For example, you cancome here to format text and numbers, or change a cell style.The Insert tab has commands forinserting things, like pictures and charts.We'll look at some of theother tabs later in this course.The Table Tools Design tabis called a contextual tabbecause it appears only whenyou're working on the table;when you select a cell outsidethe table, the tab goes away.You'll also see contextualtabs when you're working withother insertable objects, likesparklines and pivot charts.Our work sheet is prettysmall now, but there's plenty ofroom to grow in Excelas your project expands.However before we do any more work,let's save the workbook.",best way learn aboutexcel start use itthi see youstart excel first timey open exist workbookov start templatesinc firsttim let keep simpl andselect blank workbookth area wherey creat worksheetand youll find thetool need work upher area call ribbonin area youll findth name box formula baryoul see whatthos go alongnow click somewher work areathes littl rectangl call cell hold one piec inform text number formulalet say want creat worksheet track expens expans projecttyp first budget item press enterther liter millionsof cell worksheetbut one identifi usingthi grid system row columnsfor exampl address ofthi cell c6 column c row 6the name box showswhich cell selectedyoul see whyaddress import laternext type budget itemsthi breakdown workrequir expans projectif text doesnt fit cell come hold mous column border see doubl head arrow click drag border widen columnnow make worksheetmor interest let addrough estim eachwork item next columnto make number look like dollaramount well add formattingfirst select number byclick first number drag mous list gray highlight green border mean cell selectedright click selectionand right click menu opensalong box herecal mini toolbarth mini toolbar changesdepend selectin case containscommand format cellsclick dollar sign formatth number dollar amountsnow begin tolook like worksheetto make offici letsadd header row anyon look theworksheet know data mean columnnext let someth toth data make easier work withselect header data click top left corner drag themous bottom rightthi time instead rightclick hold mouseov selectionand button appearsclick thequick analysi len opensthi contain set toolsfor help analyz dataclick tabl andthen click tableand data convert tabley dont work data tabl certain advantagesfor exampl click arrow quicklysort filter datay also lot command option choos ribbonfor exampl add total row tableor remov band rowswhil letstak closer look ribbonth command option canwork organ tabsmost commandsyoul need home tabfor exampl cancom format text number chang cell styleth insert tab command forinsert thing like pictur chartswel look theother tab later courseth tabl tool design tabi call contextu tabbecaus appear whenyour work tablewhen select cell outsideth tabl tab goe awayyoul also see contextualtab your work withoth insert object likesparklin pivot chartsour work sheet prettysmal there plenti ofroom grow excela project expandshowev worklet save workbook
Save and print an Excel workbook,"Probably the most importantpart of creating a workbook,other than writing itof course, is saving it.For example, if the powerwere to go out right now,all of our hard work would be gone,unless we saved it to a file.Move up here, to this setof commands called the Quick Access Toolbar, and click Save.The first time you save a workbook, you come to this area called the Backstage. You won't find any formatting commands here.The Backstage is all aboutopening, saving, printing, sharing, exporting, andmodifying Excel options.In other words all thatbehind the scenes stuff.When you first save aworkbook, you come here to Save as.You can choose whetheryou want to save it to your computer, or to the cloud using Office 365 Sharepoint, or Skydrive.I've already signed into myonline account, so now I can click here and browse fora location on my Skydrive.Enter a filename and click Save.It's just like saving to acomputer, except that now I can access the file on anycomputer connected to the Internet.Or I can share it with others,by sending an e-mail message,containing a link to the online file.When you want to show yourworkbook to others click Save one last time, then click the File tab to go to the backstage.Click hereto print the workbook.See a preview of how theworkbook will look after it's printed.Select a printer in this list.Then click Print.You can also export your workbookin a number of formats such as PDF.Up next we'll expand our workbookby inserting more columns and rows.",probabl importantpart creat workbookoth write itof cours save itfor exampl powerwer go right nowal hard work would goneunless save filemov setof command call quick access toolbar click saveth first time save workbook come area call backstag wont find format command hereth backstag aboutopen save print share export andmodifi excel optionsin word thatbehind scene stuffwhen first save aworkbook come save asyou choos whethery want save comput cloud use offic 365 sharepoint skydriv alreadi sign myonlin account click brows fora locat skydriveent filenam click saveit like save acomput except access file anycomput connect internetor share othersbi send email messagecontain link onlin filewhen want show yourworkbook other click save one last time click file tab go backstageclick hereto print workbookse preview theworkbook look printedselect printer listthen click printyou also export workbookin number format pdfup next well expand workbookbi insert column row

Here's anotherway to expand a table.Just drag this little greenhandle in the lower right,then type your data.Now let's enter somedata in the new columns.We don't have everything yet,but we can enter what we do have.Next, select the Bid column,and format it as currency.Then click the Total row,click the arrow next to the cell, and select SUM.How about a title? We'll callthis worksheet Store Expansion.Now we can format the textto look more like a title, by using the mini toolbar to make it bold, and increase the size, and change the color.A faster way though, is togo to the ribbon and use a cell style, because you can apply a number of formatting options with one click.When you see one you like, click it.Here are some things you should know when you want to update your data; to change a cell completely, click it, and retype the data.If you don't want to retypeeverything, double click the cell, and then click to move thecursor to the parts you want to change.You can also click in theformula bar to change the cell.You saw how to add a column orrow to the outside of the table.But what if you want toadd one to the middle?Click a table header, thengo to the Home tab and click the arrow under Insert; we can insert a row or column to the entire worksheet.However, we only want to adda column in our table to the left of our selection.To delete the column:select the header, then click Delete, and Delete table columns.You can do the same thing with rows.Select a cell in the row, Insert a table row,or Delete a table row.What about copying,cutting and pasting?Well it works the same inExcel as it does in other programs;select the datayou want to copy or cut,go to the clipboard group on theHome tab, and click the command.Then click where you want topaste the data, and click Paste.Here's one less thing you mightwant to do: move a column or row.It's a little trickybecause you have to position the cursor just right for it to work.First select just the table header.Now move the mouse slowlyover the bottom border of the header, until you seea four headed cursor.Then click and drag it to the left.You should see a thickI-beam cursor; drag the cursor to the point where you want to move the column, and then release the mouse button.Of course, you can do thesame thing with rows: click when you see the arrow toselect the table row; move the mouse over a border untilyou see a four headed arrow,and then drag the I-beam to thepoint where you want to move the row.Up next, we'll make ourworksheet even more useful byputting our numbers towork for us with formulas.",project grow andchang expand worksheetlet start addingmor column tableclick column next thetabl start type press enterlet also add column contactthi time instead pressingent press tab move rightthen add biddeadlin actual cost columnsnow let chang column widthsso see headingsthi time doubl click toadjust width automaticallywhat ad rowsno problem here anotherway expand tablejust drag littl greenhandl lower rightthen type datanow let enter somedata new columnsw dont everyth yetbut enter havenext select bid columnand format currencythen click total rowclick arrow next cell select sumhow titl well callthi worksheet store expansionnow format textto look like titl use mini toolbar make bold increas size chang colora faster way though togo ribbon use cell style appli number format option one clickwhen see one like click ither thing know want updat data chang cell complet click retyp dataif dont want retypeeveryth doubl click cell click move thecursor part want changey also click theformula bar chang cellyou saw add column orrow outsid tablebut want toadd one middleclick tabl header thengo home tab click arrow insert insert row column entir worksheethowev want adda column tabl left selectionto delet columnselect header click delet delet tabl columnsy thing rowsselect cell row insert tabl rowor delet tabl rowwhat copyingcut pastingwel work inexcel programsselect datay want copi cutgo clipboard group thehom tab click commandthen click want topast data click pasteher one less thing mightwant move column rowit littl trickybecaus posit cursor right workfirst select tabl headernow move mous slowlyov bottom border header seea four head cursorthen click drag leftyou see thickibeam cursor drag cursor point want move column releas mous buttonof cours thesam thing row click see arrow toselect tabl row move mous border untily see four head arrowand drag ibeam thepoint want move rowup next well make ourworksheet even use byput number towork us formula
Add formulas and references,"I've added an over/underbudget column the worksheet tohelp us track our budget as theactual costs begin to come in.But to make that columnwork we need to add a formula.In case you hadn't noticed,Excel has already added someformulas for us downhere in the Total row.Tables can be very usefulwhen it comes to formulas,but to really understand how they worklet's try creating one on our own.Select the first cell in the column.To let Excel know we'reentering a formula, type an equal sign.Now there are a number ofways to write a formula:we could type the values ineach column with a minus sign between them, and get thecorrect result, but then what would happen if oneof the numbers changed?We'd have to rewrite the formula.To solve that problem, wecan use cell references:instead of typing the value of eachcell, we simply type the cell addresses.To help you keep track ofcell references in the formula,Excel puts a coloredhighlight on the cell.Press Enter, and Excelcalculates the formula and displays the result in the cell.Now because we used cellreferences, we can change the value, and Excel automatically updates the total.Keep in mind that eventhough the cell shows the result,the real content of thecell is still the formula.If you wonder if a cellcontains a formula,click the cell and look in the formula bar.Also we can use Autofill.Just click this little greenhandle in the cell, and drag it down.And Excel automatically fillsthe formula to the other cells.It even updates the cellreferences to point to the right cells.are displayed in parentheses.But for an even easier way toenter formulas, we can use functions.A function does all theformula writing for you.As you saw earlier, you canadd a function to the Total row by simply clicking this arrow.If you select Sum, Exceladds the SUBTOTAL function.But you can add a functionto any cell you want:select a cell, then go to theFormulas tab on the ribbon;here you have a whole library of functions.Click AutoSum, click Sum, andthe function is added to the cell.Now select the cellsyou want to add and press Enter.Click More functions to see allthe functions available in Excel.Up next will do morewith formulas and functions.",ive ad overunderbudget column worksheet tohelp us track budget theactual cost begin come inbut make columnwork need add formulain case hadnt noticedexcel alreadi ad someformula us downher total rowtabl usefulwhen come formulasbut realli understand worklet tri creat one ownselect first cell columnto let excel know wereent formula type equal signnow number ofway write formulaw could type valu ineach column minu sign get thecorrect result would happen oneof number changedw rewrit formulato solv problem wecan use cell referencesinstead type valu eachcel simpli type cell addressesto help keep track ofcel refer formulaexcel put coloredhighlight cellpress enter excelcalcul formula display result cellnow use cellrefer chang valu excel automat updat totalkeep mind eventhough cell show resultth real content thecel still formulaif wonder cellcontain formulaclick cell look formula baralso use autofilljust click littl greenhandl cell drag downand excel automat fillsth formula cellsit even updat cellrefer point right cellsar display parenthesesbut even easier way toenter formula use functionsa function theformula write youa saw earlier canadd function total row simpli click arrowif select sum exceladd subtot functionbut add functionto cell wantselect cell go theformula tab ribbonher whole librari functionsclick autosum click sum andth function ad cellnow select cellsyou want add press enterclick function see allth function avail excelup next morewith formula function
Advanced formulas and references,"I'm going to show you howto write a basic formula todemonstrate a coupleof important concepts.First, to help us keepeverything straight, let's clickthis plus sign toadd a new worksheet.Then double click theworksheet tabs and type names.Now we can add the data.The formula we're going towrite will go in this column,and use the amounts in these twocolumns, and a percentage amount.We could format the data asa table but let's leave it as it is for this demonstration.The first thing we need is acell to hold the percentage amount.Pick a cell outsidethe data and type .1then come up here to the number group and click the Percent button to format  the cell as a percentage.When we're finished, we'll be able to change this number if we want to calculate a different cost buffer amount with our formula.Now we can enter the formula.The formula adds the material and labor cells,and then multiplies that amount bythe buffer percentage cell.The asterisk is used to multiply.Press Enter to see what happens.Well it's pretty obvious this amount is not 10% of the first two columns, and the reason it's not is because I didn't consider calculation order.This this is the order in whichExcel calculates the parts of a formula.You don't need to rememberall the details, just keep in mind that multiplicationand division are calculatedbefore addition and subtraction.,And in our formula we wanted Excel to add the first cells then multiply.To tell Excel to add first,we simply insert parentheses.Now instead of multiplyingthen adding, Excel will addthe first two numbers, then multiply.Now we can use Autofill to addthe formula to the other cells.But now we run into another problem: in the first cell, the formula gets its bufferpercentage from D20;but in the next cell the formula refers to D21, and since D21 is empty, the formula multiplies byzero, and returns a value of zero.But why did Excel changethis cell reference to D21?Because when you useAutofill, or copy a formula,Excel uses relative references by default.Here's how that works:in the first cell the formula refers to these cells in row 6 and D20;when you use Autofill, Excel changesthe cell reference based onlocation to row 7 and D21.In most cases this is whatyou want, but in this case we want the formulas to always usethe value in this particular cell.To make that happen, we need to change the cell reference to an absolute reference:in the formula click D20, and then type dollar signs infront of the D, and the 20.The dollar signs tell Excelthat the formula must alwaysrefer to the cell in column Din the 20th row. Press Enter.Now when you autofill the cell,all the formulas point to D20.Now we can change the percentage tocalculate a different buffer amount.The last thing we will dois add an Estimated cost column, that uses a function.With G6 selected, click Auto-sum.Excel automatically assumes we want to add the three columns to the left, so press Enter, and then autofill the formula to the other cells.In this course you've learned the basicsof creating your first Excel workbook.",im go show howto write basic formula todemonstr coupleof import conceptsfirst help us keepeveryth straight let clickthi plu sign toadd new worksheetthen doubl click theworksheet tab type namesnow add datath formula go towrit go columnand use amount twocolumn percentag amountw could format data asa tabl let leav demonstrationth first thing need acel hold percentag amountpick cell outsideth data type 1then come number group click percent button format cell percentagewhen finish well abl chang number want calcul differ cost buffer amount formulanow enter formulath formula add materi labor cellsand multipli amount byth buffer percentag cellth asterisk use multiplypress enter see happenswel pretti obviou amount 10 first two column reason didnt consid calcul orderthi order whichexcel calcul part formulay dont need rememberal detail keep mind multiplicationand divis calculatedbefor addit subtractionand formula want excel add first cell multiplyto tell excel add firstw simpli insert parenthesesnow instead multiplyingthen ad excel addth first two number multiplynow use autofil addth formula cellsbut run anoth problem first cell formula get bufferpercentag d20but next cell formula refer d21 sinc d21 empti formula multipli byzero return valu zerobut excel changethi cell refer d21becaus useautofil copi formulaexcel use rel refer defaulther worksin first cell formula refer cell row 6 d20when use autofil excel changesth cell refer base onloc row 7 d21in case whatyou want case want formula alway useth valu particular cellto make happen need chang cell refer absolut referencein formula click d20 type dollar sign infront 20the dollar sign tell excelthat formula must alwaysref cell column din 20th row press enternow autofil cellal formula point d20now chang percentag tocalcul differ buffer amountth last thing doi add estim cost column use functionwith g6 select click autosumexcel automat assum want add three column left press enter autofil formula cellsin cours youv learn basicsof creat first excel workbook

Print a worksheet on a specific number of pages,"Page layout view shows usthat this worksheet is widerthan a page by just onecolumn, resulting in six total pages.The page count is down here.But you want to print theentire worksheet on three pages.There are several ways todo this without shrinking the worksheet, possibly making it hard to read.Which way works best fora worksheet depends on its dimensions and how you wantit to look when it prints.One way is to adjust theworksheet's margins: click the Page layout tab; click Margins; click Narrow. The page tothe right is grayed out,meaning it doesn't containdata, and it therefore won't print.The entire worksheet will nowprint in full size on three pages.Another way to print theentire worksheet on three pagesis to change theworksheet's page orientation: on the Page layout tab,click Orientation; click Landscape, and the entireworksheet will now print infull size, on three pages.To use a combination of pageorientation and paper size,to make the worksheet fiton three pages, on the Page layout tab, I clickOrientation, and click Landscape. It's still six pages, so I click Size, and click Legal, and the entire worksheet will nowprint in full size on three pages.You can also choose toshrink the worksheet to make it fit on three pages, but be careful that doing so doesn't make the worksheet hard to read.You can use the Page break preview view to configure how the worksheet will print: click the View tab; click the Page break preview view; a dotted line indicates an automatic page break; I put the mouse over it; click and hold the left mouse button; drag the dotted line to the right;and the worksheet is now on three pages.Since we shrunk theworksheet, it's a good idea to printpreview and zoom to theactual size of the page to make sure you can still read it: click File; Print; click Zoom to page,in the lower right corner of Excel, and you can look at thepreview and see if you can still read it.I want to have certaininformation on the same page, and I can do this by manuallysetting page breaks: in the Page break preview view, I click the row I want to set a page break above; you can also click a column.On the Page layouttab, I click Breaks; and click Insert Page Break.The manual page break ismarked by a solid line.I select another row, anddo the same thing, and the worksheet will still print on three pages, but have page breaks where I want them.You can change the scale ofa worksheet to make it print bigger or smaller: up here, on the Page layout tab, you can see that theworksheet scale is a 100%,and down here, that itwill print on six pages.To make it print on threepages, we need to decrease the scale: click the arrownext to width, and click 1 page; this shrinks theworksheet to one sheet wide,which happens to shrink it to threepages in length; just what we want.Again, since we shrunk theworksheet, it's a good idea toprint preview, to makesure you can still read it.You can also set the scaleto a specific number: click the Scale down arrow, until theworksheet is the size you want.You can also click inScale, and type a number.",page layout view show usthat worksheet widerthan page onecolumn result six total pagesth page count herebut want print theentir worksheet three pagesther sever way todo without shrink worksheet possibl make hard readwhich way work best fora worksheet depend dimens wantit look printson way adjust theworksheet margin click page layout tab click margin click narrow page toth right gray outmean doesnt containdata therefor wont printth entir worksheet nowprint full size three pagesanoth way print theentir worksheet three pagesi chang theworksheet page orient page layout tabclick orient click landscap entireworksheet print inful size three pagesto use combin pageorient paper sizeto make worksheet fiton three page page layout tab clickorient click landscap still six page click size click legal entir worksheet nowprint full size three pagesy also choos toshrink worksheet make fit three page care doesnt make worksheet hard readyou use page break preview view configur worksheet print click view tab click page break preview view dot line indic automat page break put mous click hold left mous button drag dot line rightand worksheet three pagessinc shrunk theworksheet good idea printpreview zoom theactual size page make sure still read click file print click zoom pagein lower right corner excel look thepreview see still read iti want certaininform page manuallyset page break page break preview view click row want set page break also click columnon page layouttab click break click insert page breakth manual page break ismark solid linei select anoth row anddo thing worksheet still print three page page break want themyou chang scale ofa worksheet make print bigger smaller page layout tab see theworksheet scale 100and itwil print six pagesto make print threepag need decreas scale click arrownext width click 1 page shrink theworksheet one sheet widewhich happen shrink threepag length wantagain sinc shrunk theworksheet good idea toprint preview makesur still read ityou also set scaleto specif number click scale arrow theworksheet size wantyou also click inscal type number
"Print headings, gridlines, formulas, and more","Here are a few more thingsyou can do with printing in Excel, including printing headings, grid lines,row and column headings and formulas.You can even mimic awatermark, and print it.The first row of thisworksheet has labels for the columns.This is referred to as a header row.Since the worksheet islonger than a page, printing the header row on every pagemakes the worksheet easier to read; you won't have tokeep flipping back to page 1 to remember what data is in a column.Click the Page layouttab and click Print titles;click in Rows to repeat attop; and then click Any cell in row 1; the entire row isautomatically filled in for me.You can select multiple rows.You can also select Columnsto repeat at left, to have columns repeat on the leftof every page: click Print Preview, and in Print Preview you can see the header will print at the top of every page.There are comments in this worksheet.When I point to the redindicator in the corner of this cell, the comment appears. When you print a worksheet, you can printthe comments at the end of the worksheet, or as they display on the worksheet.To print the comments asthey display on the worksheet,you first have to display them: click the Review tab,and click Show all comments.Now I click the Page layout tab; click Print titles; click the Comments down arrow; you have the options to print them at end of sheet, or as displayed on sheet;click As displayed onsheet; click Print Preview; and in Print Preview you can seethe comments on the worksheet.On the screen, by default,the worksheet's pages have grid lines, making it easier to read across rows, and down columns, but when you print, by default, thegridlines are not printed.To print grid lines in aworksheet, on the page layout tab, under Gridlines, check Print.Now when you print theworksheet, the gridlines areprinted, and it's easier to read.You can print rowand column headings.This is 1, 2, 3 and so on for rows, and A, B, C and so on for columns.It makes it easier todiscuss a print out if the rows andcolumns don't have somesort of sequential IDs.On the Page layouttab, under Headings, check Print; now when you printthe worksheet, the headings are printed.You want to print a watermark onyour worksheet that says ""Confidential"".There isn't a watermarkfeature in Excel, but you can come pretty close: on the Page layout tab, click Background. I already have an image I want to use;if you don't, you can findone by clicking Options, such as Bing image search;browser search to find the image you want; click it; and you worksheet now has a watermark that says ""Confidential"".Say you want to have a group review of the equations in your worksheet to makesure they're correct, but you don't want to have toclick in every cell that has a formula to do the review. Instead,click the Formulas tab,and click Show formulas,and now all the formulas,not the resulting values, are displayed in your worksheet.Print the worksheet and the formulas are printed. Now you've got a pretty good idea about how to print worksheets and workbooks.",thingsyou print excel includ print head grid linesrow column head formulasy even mimic awatermark print itth first row thisworksheet label columnsthi refer header rowsinc worksheet islong page print header row everi pagemak worksheet easier read wont tokeep flip back page 1 rememb data columnclick page layouttab click print titlesclick row repeat attop click cell row 1 entir row isautomat fill meyou select multipl rowsyou also select columnsto repeat left column repeat leftof everi page click print preview print preview see header print top everi pagether comment worksheetwhen point redind corner cell comment appear print worksheet printth comment end worksheet display worksheetto print comment asthey display worksheety first display click review taband click show commentsnow click page layout tab click print titl click comment arrow option print end sheet display sheetclick display onsheet click print preview print preview seeth comment worksheeton screen defaultth worksheet page grid line make easier read across row column print default thegridlin printedto print grid line aworksheet page layout tab gridlin check printnow print theworksheet gridlin areprint easier readyou print rowand column headingsthi 1 2 3 row b c columnsit make easier todiscuss print row andcolumn dont somesort sequenti idson page layouttab head check print printth worksheet head printedy want print watermark onyour worksheet say confidentialther isnt watermarkfeatur excel come pretti close page layout tab click background alreadi imag want useif dont findon click option bing imag searchbrows search find imag want click worksheet watermark say confidentialsay want group review equat worksheet makesur theyr correct dont want toclick everi cell formula review insteadclick formula taband click show formulasand formulasnot result valu display worksheetprint worksheet formula print youv got pretti good idea print worksheet workbook
Work with macros,"You want to automate arepetitive task in Excel, so that you can do the taskagain with a single click.The best way to dothat, record a macro.The macro recorder is the easiestway to create a new macro in Excel.Now before we getstarted, I want to make sure the developer tab is available on the ribbon, that's where all of the macro commands are.I click the File tab, options,customize ribbon, and over here I select developer and then click OK. Now I see the developer tab,and here in the code groupare the record macro buttonand some otherbuttons I'll go over later.So let's get started.I'll record an auto-fill operation, where I build a series of days based on typing Sunday in a cell.After I type Sunday, I right clickthe cell and drag it to the right.As I move over here, theTooltip show what will go in each cell, all the way through Saturday,when I get over here, Irelease the right mouse buttonand click fill series,that's what we want to record, so I'll clearthese cells and select day one.I'll repeat these steps,but this time I'll turn on the macro recorder, I click the record macro button,let's name this macro FillDays, macro names can't contain spaces, I click OK to start the recorder.See how the record macrobutton turned to stop recording?When I'm done, I'll click that.We're done with ourauto-fill, and since that's all we want to record, I'llclick stop recording.Now I clear these filledcells to clean up the worksheet,and select day one againso we can test our macro.I'll click the macro'sbutton, to bring up the macro dialog box and click run: perfect so far.I'll clear these cellsagain and this time I'll selectthe cell in a differentcolumn and row, C3, just to testthe macro a littlemore, watch what happens.The macro filled inA1 through G1,in other words it failed!So why that happened ?It happened because, by default, the macro recorder was using absolute references.Before I started recording, I shouldhave turned on use relative references.By using relativereferences, the macro will build a series by selecting theactive cell, and seeks cells to its right, instead of buildinga series using A1 through G1.Well, I know I need torecord a new macro, so I'll clear these cells and turn onuse relative references.Just to change things up abit let's start at cell B5.So I click recordmacro, give it a new name,FillDaysRelative andclick OK to start recording.I'll type Sunday, do my auto-fill and stop recording.Now I'll clear the cells andI'll switch to cells C7 and run my macro from there.This time I chooseFillDaysRelative and run, and now it works perfectly.So you can see that the relativereferences setting can be very important.In the next video, we'llrewrite the FillDaysRelativemacro manually, in an Excel toolcalled the Visual Basic Editor.",want autom arepetit task excel taskagain singl clickth best way dothat record macroth macro record easiestway creat new macro excelnow getstart want make sure develop tab avail ribbon that macro command arei click file tab optionscustom ribbon select develop click ok see develop taband code groupar record macro buttonand otherbutton ill go laterso let get startedil record autofil oper build seri day base type sunday cellaft type sunday right clickth cell drag righta move thetooltip show go cell way saturdaywhen get ireleas right mous buttonand click fill seriesthat want record ill clearthes cell select day oneil repeat stepsbut time ill turn macro record click record macro buttonlet name macro fillday macro name cant contain space click ok start recorderse record macrobutton turn stop recordingwhen im done ill click thatwer done ourautofil sinc that want record illclick stop recordingnow clear filledcel clean worksheetand select day one againso test macroil click macrosbutton bring macro dialog box click run perfect faril clear cellsagain time ill selectth cell differentcolumn row c3 testth macro littlemor watch happensth macro fill ina1 g1in word failedso happen happen default macro record use absolut referencesbefor start record shouldhav turn use rel referencesbi use relativerefer macro build seri select theactiv cell seek cell right instead buildinga seri use a1 g1well know need torecord new macro ill clear cell turn onus rel referencesjust chang thing abit let start cell b5so click recordmacro give new namefilldaysrel andclick ok start recordingil type sunday autofil stop recordingnow ill clear cell andil switch cell c7 run macro therethi time choosefilldaysrel run work perfectlyso see relativerefer set importantin next video wellrewrit filldaysrelativemacro manual excel toolcal visual basic editor
Edit a macro,"In the first video, we sawhow to record a macro, and how and why to turn onrelative references, so the macro behaves the way we want.Let's pick up where we left off with our macro: FillDaysRelative;which enters the days ofthe week in cells across a row.We will change it, so itenters the days as numbers,instead of names, andarrange them vertically in a column, instead ofhorizontally in a row.We could record a new macro,or build off of this one by editing it manually.Let's edit the macro, to see what its instructions look like.Click the macro button; here's the last macro Irecorded: FillDaysRelative;select it; and then click Edit.This opens the macro in aspecial text editor called the Visual Basic Editor.Visual Basic is the programming language that macros are recorded in.You can also create macrosfrom scratch in this editor,which is doing honestto goodness programming.Here's the macro; it'scalled a sub, or subroutine,and its name FillDaysRelative isfollowed by a pair of parentheses.I'll select all of thistext, starting with Sub, and ending with End Sub, andcopy it by pressing Ctrl-C.I'll click here at the end, press Enter and then paste what I just copied.Let's rename the originalmacro FillDaysRelativeR, for rows, and rename thecopy, FillDaysRelativeC, for columns. Since these two macros can't have the same name.I'm going to change the instructions in this copy of the macro, FillDaysRelativesC.The first thing we need to change is the first instructionActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""Sunday""We'll change the dayname to the number ""1""The next thing will do, isin the autofill designation.Change A1:G1,which is going across the row,to A1:A7, whichgoes down the A column.Change it in twoplaces, here, and also here.Those are just a couple ofminor changes, but they'll change the behavior of the macro.I'll close the Visual BasicEditor by clicking this X in the red box, and that'll save my changes.And now if I click Macros, I have three macros, and here's FillDaysRelativeC, which is the new macro, that will behave a little differently.I'll run it, and you cansee that instead of enteringSunday, Monday, and so onacross row 1, it enters the numbers 1 through 7, down column A.All that, just from acouple of minor changes that we made in the Macro Editor.In the next video, wewill save your macro to your personal Excel workbook, sothat you can use it any timewith any workbook on your computer.",first video sawhow record macro turn onrel refer macro behav way wantlet pick left macro filldaysrelativewhich enter day ofth week cell across roww chang itent day numbersinstead name andarrang vertic column instead ofhorizont roww could record new macroor build one edit manuallylet edit macro see instruct look likeclick macro button here last macro irecord filldaysrelativeselect click editthi open macro aspeci text editor call visual basic editorvisu basic program languag macro record inyou also creat macrosfrom scratch editorwhich honestto good programmingher macro itscal sub subroutineand name filldaysrel isfollow pair parenthesesil select thistext start sub end end sub andcopi press ctrlcill click end press enter past copiedlet renam originalmacro filldaysrelativ row renam thecopi filldaysrelativec column sinc two macro cant nameim go chang instruct copi macro filldaysrelativescth first thing need chang first instructionactivecellformular1c1 sundaywel chang daynam number 1the next thing isin autofil designationchang a1g1which go across rowto a1a7 whichgo columnchang twoplac also herethos coupl ofminor chang theyll chang behavior macroil close visual basiceditor click x red box thatll save changesand click macro three macro here filldaysrelativec new macro behav littl differentlyil run canse instead enteringsunday monday onacross row 1 enter number 1 7 column aall acoupl minor chang made macro editorin next video wewil save macro person excel workbook sothat use timewith workbook comput
Save your macro,"Now I want to make sure our macrois always available on this computer.I can do this by saving itto my personal macro workbook,which is a special hidden workbookthat loads every time you start Excel.I start the macro recorder,and give this macro the samename as our originalmacro: FillDaysRelativeR,but this time, underStore macro in, I choose Personal macro workbook, and click OK.Just as quickly,I stop the recording, because I didn't really need to record the steps; because I'm just going to copy over them.I bring up the Macro's dialog boxand now you cansee the macros I have.And here's the macro I justrecorded in my personal macro workbook.And here's the macrothat I want to copy.I click Edit, which bringsup the Visual Basic Editor,and this is the macro:Sub FilldaysrelativeR,so we'll select all of it,including End Sub; copy it;and then close theVisual Basic Editor.Now I'll select the macro inmy personal workbook that I want to edit,but Excel says that the workbook is a hidden workbook, and we can't edit a macro; so click OK and Cancel.Now we'll unhidethe personal workbook.To do that, click the Viewtab, and then click Unhide.Here's the hiddenworkbook, so click OK;click the Developer tab;click Macros; and select the macro in the personal workbook.I click Edit, and here arethe limited instructions that we recorded; I'll just paste over them.Now I just close the Visual BasicEditor, which saves the changes.The last thing I want to do is clean up. So I'll hide the personal .xlsb file, the hidden workbook.Click the View tab; switch thewindow to the personal workbook;and click Hide.From now on, when I work onthis computer, whether I openan existing workbook, orcreate a new one, that macro inthe personal workbookis always available.The next time I shut down Excel, it will ask me if I want to save the changes tothe personal workbook.Since I want to save this macro tomy personal workbook, I'll click Save.In the next and final video,I'll show you how to assigna button to a macro.",want make sure macroi alway avail computeri save itto person macro workbookwhich special hidden workbookthat load everi time start exc start macro recorderand give macro samenam originalmacro filldaysrelativerbut time understor macro choos person macro workbook click okjust quicklyi stop record didnt realli need record step im go copi themi bring macro dialog boxand canse macro haveand here macro justrecord person macro workbookand here macrothat want copyi click edit bringsup visual basic editorand macrosub filldaysrelativerso well select itinclud end sub copi itand close thevisu basic editornow ill select macro inmi person workbook want editbut excel say workbook hidden workbook cant edit macro click ok cancelnow well unhideth person workbookto click viewtab click unhideher hiddenworkbook click okclick develop tabclick macro select macro person workbooki click edit areth limit instruct record ill past themnow close visual basiceditor save changesth last thing want clean ill hide person xlsb file hidden workbookclick view tab switch thewindow person workbookand click hidefrom work onthi comput whether openan exist workbook orcreat new one macro inth person workbooki alway availableth next time shut excel ask want save chang toth person workbooksinc want save macro tomi person workbook ill click savein next final videoil show assigna button macro
Assign a button to a macro,"In this final video,we'll hook the macro up with a button, and make itavailable in two places:in a custom group, on the ribbon, that I will create on the Developer tab, that I'll call My Macros, and up here, on the Quick Access Toolbar.First of all, I'll create a custom group for the developer tab: I click the File tab;Options; Customize ribbon; and then I make sure Developer is checked.I click New Group, andhere's our new group!I click Rename, andcall it My Macros.Now let's find the macro andadd it to this custom group:I go over here, andchoose Commands from macros;I select the FillDaysRelativeR macro, that's stored inmy personal workbook, and click Add.Here it is! It's now in thegroup, and I want to rename it.I click Rename,and call this Fill Days.You can havespaces in display names.While I'm at it, I'llreplace its rather cryptic iconwith this icon that looks alittle bit like a calendar.I click OK; click OKagain; and here's my macro button in my custom My macro group.I click it, and it works!Now I'll show you how to addthe same macro to the Quick Access Toolbar, so it'llbe up here next to Redo.Click File; Options, and this time click Quick Access Toolbar.Again, I choose Commands for macros, and here's the macro in my personal workbook; click Add;to rename it, clickModify; call it Fill Days,and choose the same grid icon.I click OK, and click OK again.Now here it is up onthe Quick Access Toolbar!I click it, and ofcourse it works great again.Now you've got a pretty good ideaabout how to implement macros in Excel.Of course, there'salways more to learn.",final videowel hook macro button make itavail two placesin custom group ribbon creat develop tab ill call macro quick access toolbarfirst ill creat custom group develop tab click file tabopt custom ribbon make sure develop checkedi click new group andher new groupi click renam andcal macrosnow let find macro andadd custom groupi go andchoos command macrosi select filldaysrelativ macro that store inmi person workbook click addher thegroup want renam iti click renameand call fill daysyou havespac display nameswhil im illreplac rather cryptic iconwith icon look alittl bit like calendari click ok click okagain here macro button custom macro groupi click worksnow ill show addth macro quick access toolbar itllb next redoclick file option time click quick access toolbaragain choos command macro here macro person workbook click addto renam clickmodifi call fill daysand choos grid iconi click ok click ok againnow onth quick access toolbari click ofcours work great againnow youv got pretti good ideaabout implement macro excelof cours theresalway learn

Apply and change a theme,"Imagine you've createdslides for your presentation and now you're thinking about slide design, the look of the slides, thebackground design, font styles,colors and layouts.You want the slides tohave a bit more visual pop.How do you get that?Now's the time to explore themes.A theme provides a completeslide design for your presentation.Let's look at some examples.To find themes, click Design; the different themes are shown by these thumbnails here.Notice how when I point to atheme, it previews on the slide.To see more themes, click this middle arrow which shows the themes row by row. I'll point to some to show their preview.To see the full themesgallery, click this bottom arrowcalled the More arrow.To apply a theme, clickone of the thumbnails.The theme isapplied to all the slides.Some details of this themeinclude a colorful background,an artful design for theslide number and font styles.You see a color scheme appliedthroughout and a range of layouts.The aim of a theme is togive your presentation a designer quality look with allthe slide elements coordinated.Another way to apply atheme is when you first openPowerPoint to start workon a presentation - in this opening view, you're shown allthe themes from the themes gallery.You'll notice that one of the choicesis this very basic designlabelled Blank Presentation.This also has a themeapplied, just a more plain one.A helpful aspect of thisview is that when I click a theme, I see a larger example of it and I can click More images to see more examples of its color scheme and layouts.I also see three additionalchoices of background designand color scheme for the theme.When I click one ofthese, I see its preview.This is one way thatPowerPoint offers alternatives to help you get the theme you want.I'll try this blue versionof the theme which is called Ion; when I click Create,PowerPoint applies the theme tothe new presentationstarting with the first slide.When I click New Slide, thenew slide takes on that theme.An advantage to startingout with the theme in place is that I see how it looks withmy slide content as I work.If I want to try adifferent theme, I click Design and apply another one from the gallery.Now, maybe you're someone whoprefers a more plain slide design.To start with that, applythe most simple theme, the Office theme - this is the theme PowerPoint applies when you choose Blank Presentation from the opening screen.What's fun is that you canstart with this basic theme and customize it.PowerPoint gives you several ways tochange any themes design.To start with, you have thethree alternative backgroundsand color schemesover here in variantsand when you click theMore arrow on the lower right here, you have moreoptions for altering the theme.Within Colors there's a rangeof other color schemes available.Within Fonts, you'll findother font combinations for the title and body text. When I point to Fonts in the list,notice how they preview on the slide.Effects offer subtle styledifferences for graphics like shapesand Background stylesincludes more background colors,some light, some dark that gowith the current color scheme.If you alter some aspect ofyour theme and you want tosave it for future use, openthe themes gallery and clickSave current theme at thebottom of the gallery, then save the theme with a new name.The customized theme nowappears with all the other themes in the gallery foruse with other presentations.",imagin youv createdslid present your think slide design look slide thebackground design font stylescolor layoutsy want slide tohav bit visual pophow get thatnow time explor themesa theme provid completeslid design presentationlet look examplesto find theme click design differ theme shown thumbnail herenotic point athem preview slideto see theme click middl arrow show theme row row ill point show previewto see full themesgalleri click bottom arrowcal arrowto appli theme clickon thumbnailsth theme isappli slidessom detail themeinclud color backgroundan art design theslid number font stylesy see color scheme appliedthroughout rang layoutsth aim theme togiv present design qualiti look allth slide element coordinatedanoth way appli athem first openpowerpoint start workon present open view your shown allth theme theme galleryyoul notic one choicesi basic designlabel blank presentationthi also themeappli plain onea help aspect thisview click theme see larger exampl click imag see exampl color scheme layoutsi also see three additionalchoic background designand color scheme themewhen click one ofthes see previewthi one way thatpowerpoint offer altern help get theme wantil tri blue versionof theme call ion click createpowerpoint appli theme toth new presentationstart first slidewhen click new slide thenew slide take themean advantag startingout theme place see look withmi slide content workif want tri adiffer theme click design appli anoth one gallerynow mayb your someon whopref plain slide designto start applyth simpl theme offic theme theme powerpoint appli choos blank present open screenwhat fun canstart basic theme custom itpowerpoint give sever way tochang theme designto start thethre altern backgroundsand color schemesov variantsand click themor arrow lower right moreopt alter themewithin color there rangeof color scheme availablewithin font youll findoth font combin titl bodi text point font listnotic preview slideeffect offer subtl stylediffer graphic like shapesand background stylesinclud background colorssom light dark gowith current color schemeif alter aspect ofyour theme want tosav futur use openth theme galleri clicksav current theme thebottom galleri save theme new nameth custom theme nowappear theme galleri forus present
Change the theme background,"One way to personalize thetheme is to change its background.Working from the basic Office theme which has a white background, let's get more familiar with choosing a different background for a theme.Just so you know, the Office theme isthis thumbnail in the themes gallery.It also shows here on the left because it's the theme that's currently applied.What I'd like for this theme is a background with more color.To consider a different background, I should first look over in the Variants group.These three thumbnails on the right are variants to the current theme.I'm going to select thischart slide to help illustratethe differences inthese theme variants.I'll click the first variant - it keeps the white background and only changes the color scheme.You see that illustrated in the chart colors.The other two variants givea black background with two different color schemes. Notice that with these backgrounds the body text is white.I have more choicesjust for the background.To get the best view ofthese, let's display the title slide because it shows more background, then I'll click the More arrow andpoint to Background styles.These additional twelvebackgrounds, six light and six dark are other options for a background that goes with the Office theme.They are designed tocomplement and offer good contrastto the text and other theme colors.These top two rows aresolid color backgrounds.You can see the backgroundspreview on the slide when I point to it.These bottom 4 are gradient backgrounds which means they fade from lighter at the top to darker at the bottom.Let's try this one - a blue gradient; it's really more of ablue grey but we'll call it blue.I'll click through theslides to see how it looks.One big change is thatbecause it's a dark background,the slide text is nowwhite or light grey.In this background, theshading, which starts lighter atthe top and gets darker towardthe bottom, is pretty subtle.Let's make it a little moredramatic and emphasize the light to dark contrast.To work with the background,you click Format background.For a gradient type of fillwhich this background has,you have these settings to work with.What I want to do is changethe look of the gradient, so the lightest part islighter and the darkest part is darker, so I'll focuson these gradient stops.I'll explain what they are.The first stop shows thecolor of the blue at its lightest in the toparea of the slide.The last stop shows thecolor of the blue at its darkestin the bottom area of the slide.To make the lightest bluelighter I'll select the first stop, then in the box that'snext to Brightness, I'll use this arrow and increase thebrightness of the blue up to 25%.See how that lightens the bluein the top area of the background?Next I'll select the last gradient stop and decrease the brightness of thecolor, down to minus 25%.Now the bottom area of thebackground is a darker blue.I like the way the shadinglooks, so now I'll click Apply to all to make thesechanges on all the slides.One of the other thingsyou can do with gradient ischange the direction of the shading.When I click the directionarrow, I see these options.This one, Linear right,changes the light to dark shadingfrom left to right.Linear up changes the shading so itgets darker moving up toward the top.So these are some examples ofalternatives with gradient shading.To get my original shadingback, I'll choose Linear downwhich shades darkerstarting light at the top, but note that if I wasn't sure whatmy earlier shading was and I wanted to revert back to the settings I had when I last clicked Apply to all, I could click Reset background to restore those settings.I like this background so I'llclose the Format background pane.To recap you now know howto find variant choices for a theme background, choose one that goes with the theme colors and tweak itin the formatting pane.",one way person thethem chang backgroundwork basic offic theme white background let get familiar choos differ background themejust know offic theme isthi thumbnail theme galleryit also show left theme that current appliedwhat id like theme background colorto consid differ background first look variant groupthes three thumbnail right variant current themeim go select thischart slide help illustrateth differ inthes theme variantsil click first variant keep white background chang color schemey see illustr chart colorsth two variant givea black background two differ color scheme notic background bodi text whitei choicesjust backgroundto get best view ofthes let display titl slide show background ill click arrow andpoint background stylesthes addit twelvebackground six light six dark option background goe offic themethey design tocompl offer good contrastto text theme colorsthes top two row aresolid color backgroundsy see backgroundspreview slide point itthes bottom 4 gradient background mean fade lighter top darker bottomlet tri one blue gradient realli ablu grey well call blueill click theslid see lookson big chang thatbecaus dark backgroundth slide text nowwhit light greyin background theshad start lighter atth top get darker towardth bottom pretti subtlelet make littl moredramat emphas light dark contrastto work backgroundy click format backgroundfor gradient type fillwhich background hasyou set work withwhat want changeth look gradient lightest part islight darkest part darker ill focuson gradient stopsil explain areth first stop show thecolor blue lightest toparea slideth last stop show thecolor blue darkestin bottom area slideto make lightest bluelight ill select first stop box thatsnext bright ill use arrow increas thebright blue 25see lighten bluein top area backgroundnext ill select last gradient stop decreas bright thecolor minu 25now bottom area thebackground darker bluei like way shadinglook ill click appli make thesechang slideson thingsyou gradient ischang direct shadingwhen click directionarrow see optionsthi one linear rightchang light dark shadingfrom left rightlinear chang shade itget darker move toward topso exampl ofaltern gradient shadingto get origin shadingback ill choos linear downwhich shade darkerstart light top note wasnt sure whatmi earlier shade want revert back set last click appli could click reset background restor settingsi like background illclos format background paneto recap know howto find variant choic theme background choos one goe theme color tweak itin format pane
Customize colors and save the theme,"So far, in modifying the Office theme, I've changed the background from white to dark blueand I adjusted its gradient shading.Now I've found a textcolor that I want to change.This hyperlinked text in dark blueis too dark against the background.How do I make itlighter and more readable?It's not a matter of justselecting the text and changing the font color because PowerPointapplied this color automatically.Let's back up a couple of stepsand see how the color was applied.Here's the slide beforeI created the hyperlink.It was when I created the hyperlink, when I selected the text and rightclicked, chose Hyperlinkand pasted in the web address, that PowerPoint changed the text color to blue.It did that because this blue ispart of the Office themes color scheme.It's designated forany hyperlink text, so to change the color, we'regoing to alter the color scheme.This is a usefulthing to know how to do.We start by clicking the Design tab.Then we click the More arrowin Variants and point to Colors.In the list of color schemes, the Office theme colors are at the top - they're selected whichmeans that they're currently applied.All these other sets ofcolors are alternative color schemes, but I don't wantto change the whole color scheme, only one colorof the current scheme.To do that, I use thecommand at the bottom of this menucalled Customize colors.This opens a detailedpicture of the current color schemeand shows me which color isused for which things on the slide.The samples here aresnapshots of the color scheme,showing the colors for both adark and a light background.Under Theme colors, thesetop four represent alternativesfor light and darkbackgrounds and light and dark text.These accent colors are usedfor shapes and other graphics.These two colors at thebottom are the ones used for hyperlinks, the text colorof the link and the text colorafter you click the link.Looking again at thesnapshots, I can see that the colorsfor hyperlinks work well onthe light background but notso well on the dark background.So let's change thehyperlinked colors.I click the arrow next to hyperlink and see the Office theme colors in various shades; the color currently being used is selected over here.I'll look for a lighter blue.How about this one?The snapshots update to showthe changed hyperlinked color.That looks better. Next to Followed hyperlink, I'm going to make the same change.I'll click to open thecolors and select the same blue,because I don't want the colorto change when I click the link.These are my new hyperlink colors.Now I want to save thiscustomized color scheme with a new name - I'll call it OfficeBlue and click Save. The new hyperlinked color is automatically applied to the hyperlink on the slide.When I open the Colors menu, I see that the new custom color scheme is there at the top and is selected, showing that it's applied.Finally, I want to save this theme with the background and colors I've chosen so I can use it again.To do that, I open the Themesgallery and click Save current theme.I'll call itOfficeBlue and click Save.Later, for other presentations, the Office Blue themewill be available inthe Themes gallery.Now that you know how toapply, customize and save a theme, you'll design yourpresentations with confidence and flair.",far modifi offic theme ive chang background white dark blueand adjust gradient shadingnow ive found textcolor want changethi hyperlink text dark bluei dark backgroundhow make itlight readableit matter justselect text chang font color powerpointappli color automaticallylet back coupl stepsand see color appliedher slide beforei creat hyperlinkit creat hyperlink select text rightclick chose hyperlinkand past web address powerpoint chang text color blueit blue ispart offic theme color schemeit design forani hyperlink text chang color werego alter color schemethi usefulth know dow start click design tabthen click arrowin variant point colorsin list color scheme offic theme color top theyr select whichmean theyr current appliedal set ofcolor altern color scheme dont wantto chang whole color scheme one colorof current schemeto use thecommand bottom menucal custom colorsthi open detailedpictur current color schemeand show color isus thing slideth sampl aresnapshot color schemeshow color adark light backgroundund theme color thesetop four repres alternativesfor light darkbackground light dark textthes accent color usedfor shape graphicsthes two color thebottom one use hyperlink text colorof link text coloraft click linklook thesnapshot see colorsfor hyperlink work well onth light background notso well dark backgroundso let chang thehyperlink colorsi click arrow next hyperlink see offic theme color variou shade color current use select hereil look lighter bluehow oneth snapshot updat showth chang hyperlink colorthat look better next follow hyperlink im go make changeil click open thecolor select bluebecaus dont want colorto chang click linkthes new hyperlink colorsnow want save thiscustom color scheme new name ill call officeblu click save new hyperlink color automat appli hyperlink slidewhen open color menu see new custom color scheme top select show appliedfin want save theme background color ive chosen use againto open themesgalleri click save current themeil call itofficeblu click savelat present offic blue themewil avail inth theme gallerynow know toappli custom save theme youll design yourpresent confid flair
Start using PowerPoint,"Let's create aPowerPoint presentation.This is what you see whenyou first open PowerPoint.You can open an existingpresentation over here or create a new one from a template.Since this is our first time, let's start with a blank presentation.This area over here is theslide pane where you choosethe slide you want to work on,and this is where you work on it.By default PowerPoint adds a blanktitle slide when you first start.This area up here is calledthe ribbon which contains the tools for creatingyour slides and slideshow.Where do we start? Well, how abouthere where it says Click to add title?PowerPoint uses placeholderslike this to suggest what to do.And that's it. The first slide is finished.Now to add the next slide,we'll come up here to the ribbon; these buttons atthe top are called tabs.When you click a tab, yousee the commands and optionsthat are associated with that tab, and on the Home tab, there's a group of commands related to slides including New slide.This time PowerPoint adds aslide with a different layout of placeholders; type your slide title at the topthen type a list of thethings you want to talk about.PowerPoint automaticallyformats the text as bullets.Before we add more slides,let's move down to the status bar and click this button to open the Notes pane.Here you can add notes touse during your presentation;if you need more room,hold the mouse over the borderuntil you see a double-headedarrow, then drag the border up.It's usually considered abest practice to keep the amount of text on your slide to a minimum and fill in all the details with your talk.Don't worry, the audience can't see the notes, they're just for your reference.We'll get into the ways to use PowerPoint during your presentation later.",let creat apowerpoint presentationthi see whenyou first open powerpointy open existingpresent creat new one templatesinc first time let start blank presentationthi area theslid pane chooseth slide want work onand work itbi default powerpoint add blanktitl slide first startthi area calledth ribbon contain tool creatingyour slide slideshowwher start well abouther say click add titlepowerpoint use placeholderslik suggest doand that first slide finishednow add next slidewel come ribbon button atth top call tabswhen click tab youse command optionsthat associ tab home tab there group command relat slide includ new slidethi time powerpoint add aslid differ layout placehold type slide titl topthen type list theth want talk aboutpowerpoint automaticallyformat text bulletsbefor add slideslet move statu bar click button open note paneher add note tous presentationif need roomhold mous borderuntil see doubleheadedarrow drag border upit usual consid abest practic keep amount text slide minimum fill detail talkdont worri audienc cant see note theyr referencewel get way use powerpoint present later
Save a PowerPoint presentation,"Probably the most important part of creating a presentation other than writing it of course is saving it.For example, if the powerwere to go out right now, all of our hard work would be goneunless we'd save it to a file.Here's an easy way to do that.Move up here to this setof commands called the Quick access toolbar and click Save.The first time you save a presentation, you come to this area called the Backstage.You won't find any formatting commands here, the Backstage is all about opening,saving, printing, sharing, exporting and modifying PowerPoint options.In other words, all thatbehind the scenes stuff.Save as is selected whenyou first save a presentation;here you choose whetheryou want to save it to your computer or to the cloud using Office 365 SharePoint or SkyDrive. I've alreadysigned into my online account,so now I can click here andbrowse for a location on my SkyDrive, enter a filename and click Save.It's just like saving to a computer, except that now I can access the file on anycomputer connected to the Internet, or I can share it with othersby sending an email messagecontaining a link to the online file.After you save your presentation, you can keep working on it if you want, but remember to save it often so you don't lose any new work.If you want to print your presentation, click the File tab to go to the Backstageand click Print; you can see a preview of how it'll look after it's printed.Select a printerhere, then click Print.However before we do anyprinting, we need to finish the slides.",probabl import part creat present write cours save itfor exampl powerwer go right hard work would goneunless wed save fileher easi way thatmov setof command call quick access toolbar click saveth first time save present come area call backstagey wont find format command backstag openingsav print share export modifi powerpoint optionsin word thatbehind scene stuffsav select whenyou first save presentationher choos whethery want save comput cloud use offic 365 sharepoint skydriv ive alreadysign onlin accountso click andbrows locat skydriv enter filenam click saveit like save comput except access file anycomput connect internet share othersbi send email messagecontain link onlin fileaft save present keep work want rememb save often dont lose new workif want print present click file tab go backstageand click print see preview itll look printedselect printerher click printhowev anyprint need finish slide
Insert items in a presentation,"For the next slide, we wanta slightly different layout.Click the arrow inside New slide andyou get a gallery of layout options.Let's choose Two content; we'll add a title here and add text in the placeholder on the left.On the right, let's add apicture, and the easiest way todo that is to clickthis picture's icon.You can see what an icon doesby holding the mouse over it.There are also icons forinserting a table, chart, a SmartArt graphic,video or online pictures.Then select thepicture and click Insert.PowerPoint automaticallysizes and positions the picturein the placeholder, but youcan change it if you want.To help you align thepicture, click the View tab and add Grid lines and Guides.Then with a picture selected, click and drag one of the corner handles to change the size.Hold the mouse over thepicture until you see a four-headed move cursor andthen you can move the picture.These guidelines appearwhen an edge of the picture isaligned perfectlywith another element.Also did you notice that anew tab appeared on the ribbon?Whenever you select anelement on the slide, the context tab appears with a specialset of commands and optionsfor whatever you'veselected - in this case a picture.For example, you canalign or rotate the picture,change the color of the picture.Hold the mouse over anoption to see a preview or click the Picture styles Morebutton and choose a frame.Then click to select one.When you click away from thepicture, the context tab goes away.To find more things toinsert, check out the Insert tab.How about a shape?There are rectangles, arrows, callouts.

Prepare and run your presentation,"There are many options forpresenting your slideshow to an audience, but in our case we're just going to run the presentation from our laptop in a meeting room.We'll plug the meeting room projector into the laptop to make it easy for everyone in the meeting to see the slides.That'll also make iteasier for us, because with two monitors, we can use Presenter view.Here's how that works.Go to the Slideshow tab andmake sure Presenter view is selected, then click Frombeginning to run the slideshow.When you give yourpresentation, the audience sees the slides on the big screen and yousee Presenter view on your laptop.It's like a control panelthat displays the current slide, the next slide, your and there are a bunch ofoptions like pins and a laser pointer.If you don't want touse Presenter view,you can just click to changeslides or use this toolbar.You can create some prettyflashy presentations with PowerPoint or you can keep it simple and use the built-in themes and placeholders.",mani option forpres slideshow audienc case go run present laptop meet roomwel plug meet room projector laptop make easi everyon meet see slidesthatl also make iteasi us two monitor use present viewher worksgo slideshow tab andmak sure present view select click frombegin run slideshowwhen give yourpresent audienc see slide big screen youse present view laptopit like control panelthat display current slide next slide bunch ofopt like pin laser pointerif dont want tous present viewyou click changeslid use toolbary creat prettyflashi present powerpoint keep simpl use builtin theme placehold
"Print slides, notes, or handouts","You've finished creatingyour presentation and now you want to print it as ahandout for your audience.PowerPoint gives youseveral choices for handouts.To start, you click File,Print to open print view;in print view, your optionsfor page layout and printing are on the left and a previewof the handout is on the right.To see the page layoutchoices, click the Page layout button.These are the layouts.They include full-pageslides shown in the preview here,as well as layouts withmultiple slides per page.Let's look at the 3 slides layout;it has three slides on the page aswell as lines for audience notes.Another type ofhandout is the Notes page;the Notes page includes not onlythe slide but also your speaker notes.When you plan to use theyou'll type the notes you intendfor the handout in the Notes pane, below the slide. This approach is a great way to keep fromoverloading the slide with information.If you put details in the Notes pane, your audience can get those in the handout. Another thing to consider when you printhandouts is page orientation.With a portrait orientation the page is laid out vertically; with a landscape orientation, the page is laid out horizontally.You'll also decide whetherto print the handouts in coloror in one of the black andwhite formats - greyscaleor pure black and white, and you'll choose headers andfooters for the handout, things like date and page number. You click Edit header & footer to do that.Another option for handouts isto print them in Microsoft Word.To do that you wouldclick Export, Create handouts.When you click Createhandouts again, you get these layout choices for printing andformatting the handouts in Word.",youv finish creatingyour present want print ahandout audiencepowerpoint give yousever choic handoutsto start click fileprint open print viewin print view optionsfor page layout print left previewof handout rightto see page layoutchoic click page layout buttonthes layoutsthey includ fullpageslid shown preview herea well layout withmultipl slide per pagelet look 3 slide layoutit three slide page aswel line audienc notesanoth type ofhandout note pageth note page includ onlyth slide also speaker noteswhen plan use theyoul type note intendfor handout note pane slide approach great way keep fromoverload slide informationif put detail note pane audienc get handout anoth thing consid printhandout page orientationwith portrait orient page laid vertic landscap orient page laid horizontallyyoul also decid whetherto print handout coloror one black andwhit format greyscaleor pure black white youll choos header andfoot handout thing like date page number click edit header footer thatanoth option handout isto print microsoft wordto wouldclick export creat handoutswhen click createhandout get layout choic print andformat handout word
Prepare a basic handout,"To prepare my handout, I'll click File, Print to open Print view where I'llchoose the layout and other settings.I'll start with the Page layoutbutton which shows all the layouts.Until I choose adifferent layout, the one that's selected is Full page slides. This prints the slide full page in a landscapeor horizontal page orientation.You might want this layoutfor a slide that has verydetailed informationlike this process diagram.If you didn't want thefull page layout for all your slides, you could print justone slide, such as this oneusing the Print current slide option, then you'd choose another layout forthe rest of the slides.Let's look at the layouts in the Handouts section.These look more like handouts, I'll compare the 1 slide layout here, with the Full page slides layout.In the 1 slide layout theslide is smaller and the pagenow has a portrait orvertical orientation.It also has headers andfooters, a date and page numberwhich emphasize the handout format.Looking again at the Fullpage slide there are no headers and footers and it's the slide details like the slide number that are emphasized.Let's see someother handout examples.This is the 2 slides layoutand this is 3 slides, this one is popular because it includes lines for audience notes.The other layouts in theHandout section have 4 slides, 6 slides or 9 slides on a page.The numbers of slides per pageare set, you can't change those.However there aredifferent slide arrangements,these three are horizontalmeaning that the slides readleft to right on the page.These three are vertical.I'll click 9 slides vertical, here the slides read top to bottom left to right as if in columns.For this handout, I'll gowith the 3 slides layout, the slides will be readable andI like the lines for notes.Regarding page orientationthis layout automatically uses portrait, so the slides arelaid out vertically, top to bottom.I'll compare thelandscape orientation.This turns the page so it's horizontal and arranges the slides left to right.I'm going to keep theportraits setting because I likethe way thatorientation uses the space.Now, let's think aboutcolor options for the handout.My printer is set to print in colorso that's what we see in the preview.It looks great but, I'drather save the color ink andprint in black and white,I'll see how gray scale looks.I'll zoom way in so wecan see the details better.Gray scale renders allthe slide colors using gray shading. So the wildgrass detail is now gray.Gray scale also preservescolor fills such as in these chevrons where theslide number appears.I'll compare pure black and white, this removes color fills. Notice how the chevron is pure white so the slide numbers aren't visible now.There's no gray so thegrass detail is solid black.The simplicity of this canbe good, for these handoutsthough I like gray scale betterbecause it shows the slide numbers.So I've picked a layout, pageorientation and color setting for the handout.",prepar handout ill click file print open print view illchoos layout settingsil start page layoutbutton show layoutsuntil choos adiffer layout one that select full page slide print slide full page landscapeor horizont page orientationy might want layoutfor slide verydetail informationlik process diagramif didnt want theful page layout slide could print juston slide oneus print current slide option youd choos anoth layout forth rest slideslet look layout handout sectionthes look like handout ill compar 1 slide layout full page slide layoutin 1 slide layout theslid smaller pagenow portrait orvert orientationit also header andfoot date page numberwhich emphas handout formatlook fullpag slide header footer slide detail like slide number emphasizedlet see someoth handout examplesthi 2 slide layoutand 3 slide one popular includ line audienc notesth layout thehandout section 4 slide 6 slide 9 slide pageth number slide per pagear set cant chang thosehowev arediffer slide arrangementsthes three horizontalmean slide readleft right pagethes three verticalil click 9 slide vertic slide read top bottom left right columnsfor handout ill gowith 3 slide layout slide readabl andi like line notesregard page orientationthi layout automat use portrait slide arelaid vertic top bottomil compar thelandscap orientationthi turn page horizont arrang slide left rightim go keep theportrait set liketh way thatorient use spacenow let think aboutcolor option handoutmi printer set print colorso that see previewit look great idrath save color ink andprint black whiteil see gray scale looksil zoom way wecan see detail bettergray scale render allth slide color use gray shade wildgrass detail graygray scale also preservescolor fill chevron theslid number appearsil compar pure black white remov color fill notic chevron pure white slide number arent visibl nowther gray thegrass detail solid blackth simplic canb good handoutsthough like gray scale betterbecaus show slide numbersso ive pick layout pageorient color set handout
Edit headers and footers for handouts,"Before you print your handout, be sure to check the headers and footers, the small print at the top and bottom of the page.Let's zoom in for a better view.This layout automaticallyincludes the current date at the top on the right and the page number at the bottom on the right. To change these details or to add header and footer text, you click this link, Edit header & footer at the bottom of print view.In the dialog box to changethe date settings, check Date and time, then choose a different format for the date if you want. If you didn't want the date to update automatically you could check Fixed.Next to add a text header, check Header and type your text; I'll type the company name.Notice how when the header box is checked the header placeholder in the preview turns bold, indicating that the header will appear on the page.For the text footer, I'll check Footer and type in the company's web address. Then to apply these settings to all thehandout pages, I'll click Apply to all.I see the new date format is applied, the company name appears as a headerand for the text footer, there's the web address.I'll zoom back out.Now, if later you want to remove headers orfooters from the handout you click Edit header & footerand follow these steps.For the header or footertext, leave the box selected but delete the text andclick Apply to all.That removes header and footer text.To hide the date, displaythe dialog box, select Fixed,delete the date thereand click Apply to all.That removes thedate from the handout.For now though, we likehaving headers and footersand we're ready to print the handout.For more details aboutworking with headers and footersin a handout, see the Coursesummary at the end of this course.",print handout sure check header footer small print top bottom pagelet zoom better viewthi layout automaticallyinclud current date top right page number bottom right chang detail add header footer text click link edit header footer bottom print viewin dialog box changeth date set check date time choos differ format date want didnt want date updat automat could check fixednext add text header check header type text ill type compani namenotic header box check header placehold preview turn bold indic header appear pagefor text footer ill check footer type compani web address appli set thehandout page ill click appli alli see new date format appli compani name appear headerand text footer there web addressil zoom back outnow later want remov header orfoot handout click edit header footerand follow stepsfor header footertext leav box select delet text andclick appli allthat remov header footer textto hide date displayth dialog box select fixeddelet date thereand click appli allthat remov thedat handoutfor though likehav header footersand readi print handoutfor detail aboutwork header footersin handout see coursesummari end cours

Print handouts,"For your handouts, youmight wish for a document formatin which you could edit the contentand apply styles and other formatting.If so, you're in luck.You can print the handoutsin Microsoft Word; to do that, when you're ready to createhandouts, click File, Export, Create handouts. When you click Create handouts again,PowerPoint opens thisdialog box with layout choices.Two of the layouts include your speaker notes with the slides in the handout. One of these layouts arranges the notes next to the slides,the other one places theTwo other word layouts you might like include blank lines for audience notes.In one of these the lines are next to the slidesand in the other thelines are below each slide.For the layouts with notesor blank lines next to the slide, Word arranges thecontent in a table format so you can work with it in rowsor columns.This means you can use table tools.For example, when I clickDesign here under Table tools I can apply a table stylewhich defines the table bordersand each slide row.If the layout includesspeaker notes I could select themin a column andchange the formatting.For example, I'll click Home, Font size to reduce the size to 10. In a Word handout you edit the textlike you would in any document.Here I'm copying a paragraphand dragging it to the next row.If there's a slide that youwant to make more readable,you drag a corner to enlarge it.To make the table columnsadjust to the enlarged slide,you click the Layout tabunder Table tools, Select, Select table toselect the whole table,then click Autofit,Autofit contents -the table adjuststo fit the contents.You might prefer a layout that putsthe notes or lines below the slide.This produces a largerslide image and gives more spacefor the content below it.Looking again at the layoutchoices for Word, If I select this when Icreate the handouts, PowerPoint keeps a link to the Word document, then if I make a change to the slides in the presentation,I can update the handout too.I right click the slide inthe document and click Update link, and there's the new slide content.For Word handouts, notethat for header and footer contentI'd click Insert and use the header and footer commands.When I'm ready to print myWord handout I click File,Print to open print view in Word, I select my print choices there such ascolor and page orientation and then I click Print.With your knowledge ofprint and handout choices you'll create handouts that suit your audience and support a great presentation experience.",handout youmight wish document formatin could edit contentand appli style formattingif your luckyou print handoutsin microsoft word your readi createhandout click file export creat handout click creat handout againpowerpoint open thisdialog box layout choicestwo layout includ speaker note slide handout one layout arrang note next slidesth one place thetwo word layout might like includ blank line audienc notesin one line next slidesand thelin slidefor layout notesor blank line next slide word arrang thecont tabl format work rowsor columnsthi mean use tabl toolsfor exampl clickdesign tabl tool appli tabl stylewhich defin tabl bordersand slide rowif layout includesspeak note could select themin column andchang formattingfor exampl ill click home font size reduc size 10 word handout edit textlik would documenther im copi paragraphand drag next rowif there slide youwant make readabley drag corner enlarg itto make tabl columnsadjust enlarg slidey click layout tabund tabl tool select select tabl toselect whole tablethen click autofitautofit content tabl adjuststo fit contentsy might prefer layout putsth note line slidethi produc largerslid imag give spacefor content itlook layoutchoic word select icreat handout powerpoint keep link word document make chang slide presentationi updat handout tooi right click slide inth document click updat link there new slide contentfor word handout notethat header footer contentid click insert use header footer commandswhen im readi print myword handout click fileprint open print view word select print choic ascolor page orient click printwith knowledg ofprint handout choic youll creat handout suit audienc support great present experi
Work with handout masters,"When you want to printhandouts in PowerPoint, you can choose most of the handout settings in Print view, but for a few handout settingsyou need to change the handout master - a page that contains the master layout and properties for handouts.I'll show you what I mean.Let's say I'm ready to printhandouts for my presentation.I start by clicking File,Print to open print view,there I choose the type of handoutby clicking the Page layout button.I select a handout such as 4slides to a page horizontal,then I scroll down andchoose a page orientation for the handout either portrait or landscape.I'll choose landscape.PowerPoint remembers theseselections and chooses themautomatically the nexttime I open Print view.Another thing I can do inthis view is add header orfooter text to the handout. To do that, I click Edit header & footer at the bottom of the view.In the dialog box, I make surethe notes and handouts tab shows.To add a header I check theheader box, type my text and click Apply to all.The header text showsin the print preview.But, regarding the header and footer information, what if I don't want the date to appear at all or I want to reposition the header text and page number or make them bigger?To make layout andformatting changes like those I need to open the handout master.I'll start by going back to normal view. To open the handout master, you click View, Handout master.On the Handout master tab,notice this group of options.They represent all theheader and footer placeholders andyou use them to show or hidethe placeholders on the master.To hide any of them, like the dateplaceholder for example, you uncheck it.It disappears from the master.I don't really need a text footereither, I'll uncheck that placeholder too.I want a date or text footer,I'll need to recheck theplaceholder boxes on the master.Another thing I can do isformat the placeholders.For example, I'd likethe header to be centered.I'll select the headerplaceholder on the master then I'll click the Drawingtools format tab, click Align and Align Center. That centers the placeholder.To make the header's font size bigger, I'll leave the placeholder selected, click Homeand increase the font size to 14.Then I'll center the header text;pressing the down arrow, I'll movethe placeholder down just a little bit.Now I'll make similar changesto the page number placeholder.I'll center it using Alignand click Home to increase thefont size and center the page number.To close the handoutmaster, I click the Handout Master tab and click Close master view.Now I'll reopen Print view topreview the handout and print.In the Print preview, theheader and footer informationnow looks the way I want it to, reflecting the changes I made on the handout master.These settings will be in place on all subsequent handouts for this presentation.

Use Presenter view,"PowerPoint is all abouthelping you give great presentations and presenter view isall about helping you use PowerPoint.Traditionally, the audiencefaces a screen showing your PowerPoint slides and you stand in between the audience and screen and changeslides on a computer.Unless you're a professionalpresenter, you may also haveto juggle paper notes or attempt towing it by reading off your slides.Presenter view lets youtake advantage of the dualmonitor capability of a computer to separate what the audience sees from themechanics of running a slideshow.The audience views yourslides on the main screen while you control the show with presenter view on another screen that only you can see. Presenter view is like a dashboard that contains, in one windoweverything you need to run your show.You have your notes over here.This monitor shows youwhat the audience sees minustransition effects and videos, and this monitor shows you what's coming up next. You have all your tools here which you can select out of view of the audience, and you click here to move forward or back.There's even a timer that starts when you begin your presentation and a clock.By running presenter viewon a laptop just below eye level, you can face the audience andnever have to look back at the screen.You can do things likeselect a laser pointer or a drawing tool or use the slide navigator to select a different slide and only you can see all thisbehind the scenes stuff, so the audience can stayfocused on your message.Presenter view also helpsyou stay focused; all the controls are easy to get to in onewindow with big icons in a simple design.",powerpoint abouthelp give great present present view isal help use powerpointtradit audiencefac screen show powerpoint slide stand audienc screen changeslid computerunless your professionalpresent may also haveto juggl paper note attempt tow read slidespresent view let youtak advantag dualmonitor capabl comput separ audienc see themechan run slideshowth audienc view yourslid main screen control show present view anoth screen see present view like dashboard contain one windoweveryth need run showyou note herethi monitor show youwhat audienc see minustransit effect video monitor show what come next tool select view audienc click move forward backther even timer start begin present clockbi run present viewon laptop eye level face audienc andnev look back screenyou thing likeselect laser pointer draw tool use slide navig select differ slide see thisbehind scene stuff audienc stayfocus messagepresent view also helpsyou stay focus control easi get onewindow big icon simpl design
Set up your presentation,"Before you give yourpresentation in front of an audience, you can rehearse it withyour slides using presenter view.First go to the Slide show tab andmake sure Use presenter view is selected.During the show, you'lluse dual monitors but for rehearsal you canpress Alt-F5 to display presenter view on a single screen.Rehearsing this way willhelp you get comfortable withyour slides and give youpractice using presenter view.Keep in mind that whenyou're using presenter view you're in slide show mode so youcan't edit your slides or notes.This is good because itprevents you from unintentionallyaltering your slides during a show.Laptops are used by many presenters for both creating and running their shows. Most laptops available today have dual monitor capabilities built in, so when you arrive at the presentation room, all\ you have to do is plug the presentation projector or monitor into the connector on your laptop and you're ready to go.Start the show to makesure everything is working.If you want to changewhich monitors shows presenter view, click Display Settings and then click Swap presenter view and slideshow. Before the audience arrives, run through someslides to make sure everything works and you can see your laptop.Also make sure anynon-essential programs like email andbrowsers are closed andyour desktop is clean.These other programs slowdown your computer and can cause a distraction ifthe audience sees them.The last thing to dois start the slide show.Plan your PowerPointpresentation so the audience sees a welcome slide as they enter.This way the audience will knowimmediately that you're ready to begin.",give yourpresent front audienc rehears withyour slide use present viewfirst go slide show tab andmak sure use present view selecteddur show youllus dual monitor rehears canpress altf5 display present view singl screenrehears way willhelp get comfort withyour slide give youpractic use present viewkeep mind whenyour use present view your slide show mode youcant edit slide notesthi good itprev unintentionallyalt slide showlaptop use mani present creat run show laptop avail today dual monitor capabl built arriv present room plug present projector monitor connector laptop your readi gostart show makesur everyth workingif want changewhich monitor show present view click display set click swap present view slideshow audienc arriv run someslid make sure everyth work see laptopalso make sure anynonessenti program like email andbrows close andyour desktop cleanthes program slowdown comput caus distract ifth audienc see themth last thing doi start slide showplan powerpointpresent audienc see welcom slide enterthi way audienc knowimmedi your readi begin
Deliver your presentation,"The audience has settled in and you're about ready to begin the presentation.

You canclick either monitor, click the forward arrow orpress the space bar.This slide starts with a title.The preview monitor showsthat the next time we advance the slides the first bullet will animate on, then the second bullet and so on.Notice that you won't seeanimations or transitions in presenter view, but don't worry they'll look fine on the audience's screen.If you want to go back press, theback arrow or the backspace key.If you want to jump to aslide, click the See All Slides button and click a thumbnail.If you know the slide number, you can type it and press Enter and if you want to run a custom show that you created in PowerPoint, click the Options buttonand then select a show.Your notes are over here.To change the size of thetext, click these buttons.Use the mouse to scroll the textor press Control andthe down or up arrow.Underneath the big monitoryou have your tools and options.Click the pen to select alaser pointer, pen or highlighter.You can also change pen colorsand erase all the ink on the slide.Click this button to selectan area on the slide to zoom into; click it again to zoom to normal size.

Backgrounds in PowerPoint: First Steps,"In this course, we're going towork with backgrounds in PowerPoint.You could start with thetheme that controls backgroundsand colors and fonts, butif you want to start from scratch, that's whatwe're going to dig into.So here I have almost a blank slide and to get to the background menu, I just right click on my mouse and I can see Format background.Now one thing, you want tomake sure you click on a blankpart of the slide, if Iclick on this image or I clickover here on this text box,I get a different menu when I right click, so someplaceno element, right click,Format background andit opens up this menu.Let's jump into Solid filland we choose -we just click on this fill color boxand it gives me colors.Now even though this is ablank presentation it has a theme, it's called the Office theme and each theme hasits own palette of colors,that's why these are chosen.But you also can use standard colorsor you can click here for more colors.First there's a color wheelyou can choose a color on, or you can go to Custom. Custom is great because you can plug in values.There's a thing called RGBcolors and they have a number value; if you get those fromyour designer, you can plug those in and get the exact color,let's say for your company colors.You can put that in your PowerPoint.But there's also a shortcut for thatand this is new in PowerPoint 2013.Let me go over here to Color and go down to this Eyedropper tool and click that and then move our… Now the very tip of thiseyedropper, if you put it on a color -or if you rest there it shows you the RGB colors - but if you click it, there you go it turns the background that color right from that image.A couple of things with thecolor: 1, don't be afraid to use white-black, I mean this is your background.This shouldn't be, you know, the star is the foreground of your presentation. Also if you use a strong color,it's going to limit the color palette, I mean think about those PowerPoints we've seen where you've had those blue,dark blue backgrounds they putblack text on, it's really hard to read.Also if you're going to bein an auditorium, someplace dark where the audience isdark, make sure you use a dark or black background. OK, let's go on and show Gradient fill; click that and you can seeit kind of blends light and color.In fact the tot part here iswhite and the color comes in at the bottom corner. Now if you look over the menu,there's tons of different ways you canfiddle with this as much as you want.I'll just show you a presetor two; if I click this one,now the light is at thebottom and the corners are dark.Finally we're going to show a texture fill and go down here to this box, thislittle box here that says Textureand shows you some premade ones.There's some marble, there's cloth, there's some other things you can use, this is a paper bag I kind of like.You click on that.  Now one thing with a strong background is, you can see it's hardto read text on that, so you can lighten that up withthis Transparency tool.It's a bar, you just clickon it and move it to get the lightness that you wanted.You can see what you want, andthen unclick and there you have it.If you like this for the background, any time that you like the background, you just go down here to Apply to all and you can click thatand it applies that backgroundto all of the slides.",cours go towork background powerpointy could start thethem control backgroundsand color font butif want start scratch that whatwer go dig intoso almost blank slide get background menu right click mous see format backgroundnow one thing want tomak sure click blankpart slide iclick imag clickov text boxi get differ menu right click someplaceno element right clickformat background andit open menulet jump solid filland choos click fill color boxand give colorsnow even though ablank present theme call offic theme theme hasit palett colorsthat chosenbut also use standard colorsor click colorsfirst there color wheelyou choos color go custom custom great plug valuesther thing call rgbcolor number valu get fromyour design plug get exact colorlet say compani colorsy put powerpointbut there also shortcut thatand new powerpoint 2013let go color go eyedropp tool click move tip thiseyedropp put color rest show rgb color click go turn background color right imagea coupl thing thecolor 1 dont afraid use whiteblack mean backgroundthi shouldnt know star foreground present also use strong colorit go limit color palett mean think powerpoint weve seen youv bluedark blue background putblack text realli hard readalso your go bein auditorium someplac dark audienc isdark make sure use dark black background ok let go show gradient fill click seeit kind blend light colorin fact tot part iswhit color come bottom corner look menuther ton differ way canfiddl much wantil show presetor two click onenow light thebottom corner darkfin go show textur fill go box thislittl box say textureand show premad onesther marbl there cloth there thing use paper bag kind likey click one thing strong background see hardto read text lighten withthi transpar toolit bar clickon move get light wantedy see want andthen unclick itif like background time like background go appli click thatand appli backgroundto slide
90 seconds about PowerPoint Slide Masters,"If you want to go furtherinto the backgrounds, you need to know a little bitabout slide masters.Slide masters are kind of theskeleton of your PowerPoint.You can view it at anytime; on the Home menu go overhere to New slide andclick on that and you can seethere's a whole bunch ofdifferent slides in that theme.They have different elementsto them and that's great to use.Any time you do a new slide,just don't copy or duplicatethe previous slide, youcan use a new one here.Now you can edit those andthat's what the master slide can do; I'll show youhow to get into that.So click up here in themenu and click View and then click Slide master and now everything on the left-hand side is the slide master.You're not working on your presentation anymore, you're just working on slide masters.Let me make these alittle bigger for you.So, you can change anythinghere and you can use those slides. This one of the top,you want to be careful, that's a little extra bigbecause it's extra special.Anything you put on thisslide will appear in all the other slides; again youwant to be careful with that.When you're done withslide masters, just click here,close Master view andyou're back to your presentation.We'll show you how to putsomething in there like a watermark in our next video.",want go furtherinto background need know littl bitabout slide mastersslid master kind theskeleton powerpointy view anytim home menu go overher new slide andclick seether whole bunch ofdiffer slide themethey differ elementsto that great useani time new slidejust dont copi duplicateth previou slide youcan use new one herenow edit andthat master slide ill show youhow get thatso click themenu click view click slide master everyth lefthand side slide masteryour work present anymor your work slide masterslet make alittl bigger youso chang anythingher use slide one topyou want care that littl extra bigbecaus extra specialanyth put thisslid appear slide youwant care thatwhen your done withslid master click hereclos master view andyour back presentationwel show putsometh like watermark next video
Picture backgrounds: Two methods,"So here we're going toshow you a couple of differentways to use a picture background. A lot of people want to use a watermark or even a logo; to do that as we talked about in the previous video, you need to open up your slide masters.So let's do that. Let's go over here to View and click Slide master and now again the left-hand side is no longer your presentation,it's all of the slide masters.You could pick the top oneand put something there but that would - anything you puthere will be an all of your slides.I don't think you need yourlogo on all your slides, just maybe a few of them, unlessyou're doing something for security.So I'm going to pick this slidehere, I'm going to put something here.Now if you're doingsomething small, you'd just insert it like a regular picture, it's not background just a little watermark so let's say a logo.So, Insert, Pictures, youcan grab them from online, I'm going to grab them from my desktop here and I'll grab the logo and I can drag this around to where I want it, I just click the outsideand I can pull it down.There's some guides that popup that kind of guide you inand tell you whenyou're level with things.I'm going to put it rightthere and this will appearanytime I'd choose thisslide in my presentation.I'll show you that in justa moment, but since I'm herelet's just add a picturebut we're going to add a background picture thewhole width, so to do that, what we want to do is rightclick on the blank part of the slide, Format background.We'll come back over hereto Picture or Texture fill,except this time we'regoing to choose a picture under File and I'm going to choose this picture - might be something for a, let's saya first slide for a jumping off event or maybe this is a slide we use a lot in our advertising we want to use.Now it's a pretty strongpicture with a lot of colors, so again this is the backgroundwe want to drop it down, it's the foreground that's important.So I click this transparency bar andmove that down quite a ways actually.Just so it's subtly there.OK. And when I'm done, go upto Close master view in the ribbon and now I'm back to my presentation and here I'm going to add a new slide, andhere's this new slide I just made.So I can choose that one anytime Iwant the background with the logo.Now there's another ways touse pictures that I think is a little bit - for me, it's a lot more fun, but I think it's a vibrant way of doing it.Let me show you that.I'm going to justinsert a regular picture.Let me get a new slidehere, a new blank slide and then I'm going to insert a picture.I'm going to choose the same picture.I'm going to changea few things here.I'm going to close theFormat menu here by clicking the box and then down here onthe bottom right-hand corner,that's the zoom, that'sit's not controlling the slidesit's controlling the workspace. And what I want to do is I want to make this smaller. Now the large white box, that's the slide itself with the picture, you can see what it's going to look likehere in the thumbnail on the left-hand side, so kind of watch both spaces, but what I want to do here is I want to take this picture and I'm going to use anelement of the picture.One of the things, thatwe have these big beautifulpictures now and if you havesomething that has a lot ofa quality to it you can blow itup and it still looks really nice.So you can kind of see whatI'm doing here, I just wantto grab an element of this picture, just kind of the steps, the kind of theaction of the picture.And it has a nice bignegative space here, the cement.That's a great place to put text.So let's do that. Let'sclick Insert, Text box.Let's put a big text boxin here, let me just type insomething really quick.Let me make a big font here,something they can read in the back row.So then I can put the textand again I can kind of seewhere it's going to be ifI look at the left side.If I look at the thumbnailat the same time and now letme show you what it lookslike when it's fully done- there! That's a great wayI think to use a big vibrantpicture with some action,that it's a background butstill it's not that kindof just barely there, it's really vibrant and canreally help tell your story.In fact we can do even -you want to do a little extra?We'll do a little extra. Watch this!

Removing backgrounds in PowerPoint,"For our last video, we'll talk aboutremoving backgrounds in PowerPoint.Most of the time whenpeople want to remove background,it's because they were given adeck, they inherited a deck maybe.Well, in this example thisCharity Ball Auction, let's say this is last years deck,I'm in charge this year and I want to clean up the deckto give it a different look.Now, is this abackground I can change?It's not a solid background.Now one clue is, look atthe left-hand side, all those slides, the backgroundslook the same with that stripeand if I click under Layout you see all the slides. They're all themed; this is a theme I'm dealing with not just a solid background.So, to change the theme, I go up to Design and really you could change it quicklyright here, you can see what -you just put your mouse overeach look, you can see what it looks like, it changes everything.But I'm going to just use ablank presentation, so let me do that and use this one here, this Office theme. It changes the fontsa bit, but it keeps the text,it keeps the pictures and I canstart with a fresh background.Now pictures here, look, thismain picture here I want to change.Now watch this, when I clickon it, as soon as I clickedthe picture I get this boxaround it that selects the picture.So now I can move it around or I can just simply delete it. I'll do that.Now let me go down tothis, let's say this companydoesn't own us anymore so Iwant to get rid of this logo.I click on it but there'sno box, nothing happens.The reason, and if you'vebeen watching the videos, you know it's because this image is noton this slide it's on the slide master.So I have to go inthere to delete it.So let's go up to Viewand click Slide masterand now the left-hand sideis no longer my presentationit's all the slide masters. And as you can see in the bottom right-hand corner there is a logo on each one of those slides. So let me go to the very top on this big master slide and there it is.So let me click on that to select it and now on the right hand side I'm going to choose this and anything on this main slide will be on all the other slides.So if I go down here to the logoand click it, now I get the box.So now I've selected itand I can simply delete it.Let me show you that again; if you look on the left-hand side of the thumbnails as soon as I deleted it will disappear from all of the slides.When I'm done, click Closemaster view and now I'm back,I have a very cleanbackground and for me I'm ready tobuild the auction, theCharity ball and auction for this year, make new backgrounds, new pictures.",last video well talk aboutremov background powerpointmost time whenpeopl want remov backgroundit given adeck inherit deck maybewel exampl thischar ball auction let say last year deckim charg year want clean deckto give differ looknow abackground changeit solid backgroundnow one clue look atth lefthand side slide backgroundslook stripeand click layout see slide theyr theme theme im deal solid backgroundso chang theme go design realli could chang quicklyright see put mous overeach look see look like chang everythingbut im go use ablank present let use one offic theme chang fontsa bit keep textit keep pictur canstart fresh backgroundnow pictur look thismain pictur want changenow watch clickon soon clickedth pictur get boxaround select pictureso move around simpli delet ill thatnow let go tothi let say companydoesnt us anymor iwant get rid logoi click theresno box noth happensth reason youvebeen watch video know imag noton slide slide masterso go inther delet itso let go viewand click slide masterand lefthand sidei longer presentationit slide master see bottom righthand corner logo one slide let go top big master slide isso let click select right hand side im go choos anyth main slide slidesso go logoand click get boxso ive select itand simpli delet itlet show look lefthand side thumbnail soon delet disappear slideswhen im done click closemast view im backi cleanbackground im readi tobuild auction thechar ball auction year make new background new pictur
Get going fast,"If you already knowPowerPoint 2003 and want to get up tospeed fast with PowerPointthen you're in the right place.When you see PowerPoint for thefirst time, you'll notice some changes.First there's a ribbon wherethe menu bar used to be, all of your favorite commands are stillthere but now they're easier to get to.For example, here's whereyour formatting buttons are and here's where you insert things like pictures and text boxes. Need to check spelling - it's on the Review tab.Look at this, betterlooking charts and diagrams.Go to the Insert taband then click Chart.Choose a chart type on the left andyou'll see a preview on the right.Click OK, and there,a great looking chart.The file format is new;now when you save a new presentation, you'll create a .pptx file by default not a .ppt file, but don't worry you can always create a .ppt file if you want and you can always open them too, in case someone sends you one.Look what happens nowwhen you click File.This is the backstagewhere you go to manage your presentation and it's also whereyou go to set PowerPoint options.The backstage is also whereyou go to save and open filesand also where you go to shareand export the presentations.So we've just shown you aquick overview of what's changed.Now let's go into more detail.",alreadi knowpowerpoint 2003 want get tospe fast powerpointthen your right placewhen see powerpoint thefirst time youll notic changesfirst there ribbon whereth menu bar use favorit command stillther theyr easier get tofor exampl here whereyour format button here insert thing like pictur text box need check spell review tablook betterlook chart diagramsgo insert taband click chartchoos chart type left andyoul see preview rightclick ok therea great look chartth file format newnow save new present youll creat pptx file default ppt file dont worri alway creat ppt file want alway open case someon send onelook happen nowwhen click filethi backstagewher go manag present also wherey go set powerpoint optionsth backstag also wherey go save open filesand also go shareand export presentationsso weve shown aquick overview what changednow let go detail
A first look at PowerPoint 2016,"When you open the newversion of PowerPoint for the first time, this is what you see.It's a little differentfrom the blank presentation you saw when you open PowerPoint 3.In this version, you start bychoosing what you want to do.You can choose a templateor theme and create a newpresentation or open anexisting presentation here.Let's see what happens when weopen a PowerPoint 2003 presentation.It looks about the same andit works about the same too;all the basic tools andfeatures you're used to are still here.You can insert new slides,type titles and bullets the same way you did before; the commands are just organized differently.You used to select a menuitem then click a command, now you select a tab on theribbon and click a command.By default the Home tab isselected when you first open PowerPoint and if you wantto get up to speed fast, this is where you'll findmost of what you need.For example, let's select this textand change the font color and the size.Notice that you can move themouse over a size and see a preview before you select it.Of course in PowerPoint youoften need visuals and chartsare usually the way to go.In PowerPoint 2003 you clicked the Insert menu or you clicked the Chart button. In the new version of PowerPoint you go to the Insert tab.This is where you go to insert anything, a table, picture or a data chart. What about thecharts that are not based on data?That's where SmartArt comes in handy.SmartArt lets you inserttext based charts like lists,processes and org charts.When it comes time to saveyour presentation, you can use the Save command up hereor you can use the familiar keyboard shortcut Ctrl-S. What is the compatibility checker?It appeared because we're saving a .ppt file that was createdin PowerPoint 2003 and it is warning us that this neworg chart we inserted will not be editable in earlierversions of PowerPoint.Click continue to save the file anyway and let's see how the file looks in PowerPoint 2003.Sure enough, we cannot editthe text in this chart, but other than that everything is fine.So let's take a closerlook at that message.It comes up everytime we save the file.You can clear this checkboxto make the message go away,but as you can see uphere you are running inCompatibility Mode because PowerPoint is saving the file in the old .ppt format. PowerPoint will essentially work the same as it always has, but in Compatibility Mode you'll miss out on a few new features like for example, if I switch over to a .pptx file, I have lots of choices for slidetransitions, like this one - Vortex,but if I go back to the .ppt file in Compatibility Mode I don't have as many transitions to choose from and I certainly don't have Vortex.So if you don't need to openthe file in PowerPoint 2003,the best thing to do isconvert it to the new .pptx format and here's how to do that.Click the File tab to goto the backstage, click Infothen click Convert.We get the Save as dialog box asking where we want to save the converted file. Click Save to save it in the same folder as the old file.Now we have two files, one with a .ppt extension that is compatible with PowerPoint 2003 and one with the. pptxextension that is formatted for the new version of PowerPoint.Let's leave the older file and continue working on the .pptx file and see now we have more transitions and most importantly Vortex.We'll get into Compatibility Modein more detail in the final video.So, you're well on your wayto making the switch to the new version of PowerPoint, nowstick around and we'll do more.",open newvers powerpoint first time seeit littl differentfrom blank present saw open powerpoint 3in version start bychoos want doyou choos templateor theme creat newpresent open anexist present herelet see happen weopen powerpoint 2003 presentationit look andit work tooall basic tool andfeatur your use still herey insert new slidestyp titl bullet way command organ differentlyy use select menuitem click command select tab theribbon click commandbi default home tab isselect first open powerpoint wantto get speed fast youll findmost needfor exampl let select textand chang font color sizenotic move themous size see preview select itof cours powerpoint youoften need visual chartsar usual way goin powerpoint 2003 click insert menu click chart button new version powerpoint go insert tabthi go insert anyth tabl pictur data chart thechart base datathat smartart come handysmartart let inserttext base chart like listsprocess org chartswhen come time saveyour present use save command hereor use familiar keyboard shortcut ctrl compat checkerit appear save ppt file createdin powerpoint 2003 warn us neworg chart insert edit earliervers powerpointclick continu save file anyway let see file look powerpoint 2003sure enough editth text chart everyth fineso let take closerlook messageit come everytim save filey clear checkboxto make messag go awaybut see upher run incompat mode powerpoint save file old ppt format powerpoint essenti work alway compat mode youll miss new featur like exampl switch pptx file lot choic slidetransit like one vortexbut go back ppt file compat mode dont mani transit choos certainli dont vortexso dont need openth file powerpoint 2003the best thing isconvert new pptx format here thatclick file tab goto backstag click infothen click convertw get save dialog box ask want save convert file click save save folder old filenow two file one ppt extens compat powerpoint 2003 one pptxextens format new version powerpointlet leav older file continu work pptx file see transit importantli vortexwel get compat modein detail final videoso your well wayto make switch new version powerpoint nowstick around well
How things are organized,"So your first question might be:why did Microsoft redesign office?It worked fine before.Well the answer is, simply tomake the programs easier to use.Of course you can work anyway you want, but the commandsI use most often areright here on the slide.First there's theright-click menu, then there's something new called the mini toolbar which is great for doing quick taskslike indenting a bullet.There's also this; when you clicka data chart, these buttons appear.With this you can instantlyadd or remove all kinds of stuff like the titleof the chart or a legendand with this you canchange the style of the chart.The commands I use fairlyoften are located on the ribbon.The ribbon commandsare organized into tabsand tab commands areorganized into groups.We'll look at those inmore detail in the next video.The commands I use less often can be found by clicking one of these little arrows.They open dialog boxes - look familiar? Many of them are identical to the ones you used in PowerPoint 2003.Finally, to get to the commands I use least often, I go to the backstage.This is where you open,save, share and export files.For example, click Print to set upyour printer or print your presentation.And look at this, yourprint preview is right here.The options I use even lessfrequently are here in Options.This is where you set upgeneral PowerPoint preferences.Options is also where youcome to customize the ribbon,if there are certaincommands you want quicker access to.So that's basicallyhow things are organized.",first question might bewhi microsoft redesign officeit work fine beforewel answer simpli tomak program easier useof cours work anyway want commandsi use often areright slidefirst there therightclick menu there someth new call mini toolbar great quick taskslik indent bulletther also clicka data chart button appearwith instantlyadd remov kind stuff like titleof chart legendand canchang style chartth command use fairlyoften locat ribbonth ribbon commandsar organ tabsand tab command areorgan groupswel look inmor detail next videoth command use less often found click one littl arrowsthey open dialog box look familiar mani ident one use powerpoint 2003final get command use least often go backstagethi opensav share export filesfor exampl click print set upyour printer print presentationand look yourprint preview right hereth option use even lessfrequ optionsthi set upgener powerpoint preferencesopt also youcom custom ribbonif certaincommand want quicker access toso that basicallyhow thing organ
A closer look at the ribbon,"Let's start by looking at thecommands on the ribbon more closely.We've already covered the Home tab, these are the ribbon commands you will probablyuse most often as you work on a presentation and we covered the Insert tab earlier as well, this is where you insert stuff.We pointed out Pictures, Charts and SmartArt earlier but this is also where you work with headers and footers and where youinsert audio and video.One quick note about extratabs that appear for certain things; with the video selected, we get the Video tools tabs.These tabs here are used towork with the video, we can adjust the brightness and color,set a style,click Playback and we cancustomize how the video plays.For example, we couldchoose to play it full screen or have it loop until stopped. On the Design tab, you have features that let you change the overall look of your presentation. In PowerPoint 2003 you had designed templates but in this version you have themes.A theme applies a professional looking set of fonts and colors to everything. Select the one you like and then choose a variant if you want.The Design tab also hascommands for working with Slide size and the background.The Transitions tab is great, weshowed this to you earlier as well.This is where you go to addtransition effects in between slides.Choose a transition but remember to look over here on the right too, you have Effect options, theApply to all button and other features to refineyour transitions even further.So if the Transitions tab isfor animated effects between slides, then the Animations tab is where you add animations to things on a slide like text, shapes, charts and so on. Select what you want to animateand choose an animationand again remember to lookon the right, you can chooseEffect options tofurther customize the effect.You might be asking yourself,where's the custom animation task pane?Well open theAnimation pane and you'll see.This pane shows theanimation timeline and if you're looking for Effect andtiming options, click this arrow.The Slide show tab is allabout the big moment, actually presenting your slides to people.This is where you start the show either from the beginning or from the current slide.If you're used to startingthe show on PowerPoint 2003using a button down here,you can still use that buttonbut now it's moved over here.The next tab, the Reviewtab, is not to be overlooked.This is where you go tocheck spelling, insert commentsand where you can compare yourcurrent presentation with another one.And the last but not least tab, View.This is the place for things that were on the old View menu, Slides sorter view,the Ruler, Grid lines and Guides. Your Zoomoptions are here tooand here's a tricky thingto remember, Outline view is here, it's no longer a tabat the top of the thumbnails.After you have worked hardon your slides, it's time to Save, Export orShare your presentation.",let start look thecommand ribbon closelywev alreadi cover home tab ribbon command probablyus often work present cover insert tab earlier well insert stuffw point pictur chart smartart earlier also work header footer youinsert audio videoon quick note extratab appear certain thing video select get video tool tabsthes tab use towork video adjust bright colorset styleclick playback cancustom video playsfor exampl couldchoos play full screen loop stop design tab featur let chang overal look present powerpoint 2003 design templat version themesa theme appli profession look set font color everyth select one like choos variant wantth design tab also hascommand work slide size backgroundth transit tab great weshow earlier wellthi go addtransit effect slideschoos transit rememb look right effect option theappli button featur refineyour transit even furtherso transit tab isfor anim effect slide anim tab add anim thing slide like text shape chart select want animateand choos animationand rememb lookon right chooseeffect option tofurth custom effecty might ask yourselfwher custom anim task panewel open theanim pane youll seethi pane show theanim timelin your look effect andtim option click arrowth slide show tab allabout big moment actual present slide peoplethi start show either begin current slideif your use startingth show powerpoint 2003use button herey still use buttonbut move hereth next tab reviewtab overlookedthi go tocheck spell insert commentsand compar yourcurr present anoth oneand last least tab viewthi place thing old view menu slide sorter viewth ruler grid line guid zoomopt tooand here tricki thingto rememb outlin view longer tabat top thumbnailsaft work hardon slide time save export orshar present
"Save, publish, and share","After you finished your presentation,PowerPoint has many options for Saving, Sending, Printing and Sharing it and you'll find all thoseoptions here in the backstage.Like Save as, we used itbefore to save our converted presentation but you can also save a presentation to an online service likeOffice 365 and OneDrive.I've already logged into myaccount in PowerPoint so now I can save the presentation to my OneDrive the same way I'd save to my computer,only now I can access it from any computer connected to the Internet.Click Share after you save apresentation if you want to share it with others or you can Export it in anumber of other file types such as PDF or create a videofile of your presentation.Now you have a pretty goodidea of what's involved inmaking the switch from PowerPoint2003 to the new version of PowerPoint.There's just one more thing youshould know and it's about compatibility.In the second video weconverted a PowerPoint 2003.ppt file to the new .pptx format. The two formats are different but in most cases you will only run into a problem when you want to share your presentation withsomeone who uses PowerPoint 2003.If that's the case,you have two options.First go to the backstage, click Info, click Check for issues and thenrun the compatibility checker.If you decide to move ahead,then you can save the file as a .ppt file. Click Save as, choose a location and then inthe Save as dialog boxchange the Save as typeto PowerPoint 97-2003.Then, the person you were sharing the file with can open the presentation in the older version of PowerPoint.The second option for the personusing PowerPoint 2003 is to go to office.com and download an add-incalled the Compatibility pack.So that's it, you shouldhave all the information you need to make the switch tothe new version of PowerPoint.Of course there's more to learn.",finish presentationpowerpoint mani option save send print share youll find thoseopt backstagelik save use itbefor save convert present also save present onlin servic likeoffic 365 onedriv alreadi log myaccount powerpoint save present onedr way id save computeronli access comput connect internetclick share save apresent want share other export anumb file type pdf creat videofil presentationnow pretti goodidea what involv inmak switch powerpoint2003 new version powerpointther one thing youshould know compatibilityin second video weconvert powerpoint 2003ppt file new pptx format two format differ case run problem want share present withsomeon use powerpoint 2003if that casey two optionsfirst go backstag click info click check issu thenrun compat checkerif decid move aheadthen save file ppt file click save choos locat inth save dialog boxchang save typeto powerpoint 972003then person share file open present older version powerpointth second option personus powerpoint 2003 go officecom download addincal compat packso that shouldhav inform need make switch toth new version powerpointof cours there learn
Working with watermarks,"You can call it a background image or semi transparent text but it's also knownas a watermark, some sort of background image that canappear throughout a PowerPoint presentation, like a company logo for example.Watermarks can be used foridentification or branding,for security or illegal purposes orsimply as a designer decorative element.Let's add a watermark to this presentation that identifies it as a draft version.Click the View tab andopen the slide master,then select the slide master.By putting the watermark here, it will appear on the background of every slide. On the Insert tab, click Text box then draw a large text boxand type Draft. Select the text,enter a font size ofaround 250 to 300 and change the font style if you want.You may need towiden the text box a bit.Next, go to the top of the text box and click this circular arrowcalled the Rotate handle.Drag it to the left so the textangles upward and fills the slide.Then center the text in the text box and go to the Drawing tools format tab andclick Align and Align center.Then click Align middle.Next, we need to dosomething to the watermark so it doesn't fight withour foreground elements.Select the text and on theDrawing tools format tab,click the Format text effectsdialog box launcher and this pane opens.Click the Text options tab and thenclick the Text fill and outline tab.Under Text fill, click theTransparency slider and drag it to about 80. You need to find the right balance between being too prominent and too much in the background.Finally click Sendbackward and Send to back, this places ""draft"" on a layerbehind the elements on your slide but just aboveyour slide background.To make the text even lessobtrusive you can come up here to Text fill and remove the fill and add an outline color. Then adjust the Outline transparency.Close the slide masterand let's see how the watermark looks behind our content.Check through the slides;if you need to, go backinto the slide master and readjust the transparency level.You decide how noticeableyou want the watermark to be.You could even cutit back to 90 percent.One more thing, if you'rehappy with a watermark, you can turn it into an Image file.Right click the text boxand click Save as picture.Decide where you want to saveit, type a name and click Save.Now you can insert thepicture in your next slideshow.",call background imag semi transpar text also knowna watermark sort background imag canappear throughout powerpoint present like compani logo examplewatermark use foridentif brandingfor secur illeg purpos orsimpli design decor elementlet add watermark present identifi draft versionclick view tab andopen slide masterthen select slide masterbi put watermark appear background everi slide insert tab click text box draw larg text boxand type draft select textent font size ofaround 250 300 chang font style wantyou may need towiden text box bitnext go top text box click circular arrowcal rotat handledrag left textangl upward fill slidethen center text text box go draw tool format tab andclick align align centerthen click align middlenext need dosometh watermark doesnt fight withour foreground elementsselect text thedraw tool format tabclick format text effectsdialog box launcher pane opensclick text option tab thenclick text fill outlin tabund text fill click thetranspar slider drag 80 need find right balanc promin much backgroundfin click sendbackward send back place draft layerbehind element slide aboveyour slide backgroundto make text even lessobtrus come text fill remov fill add outlin color adjust outlin transparencyclos slide masterand let see watermark look behind contentcheck slidesif need go backinto slide master readjust transpar levely decid noticeabley want watermark beyou could even cutit back 90 percenton thing yourehappi watermark turn imag fileright click text boxand click save picturedecid want saveit type name click savenow insert thepictur next slideshow
Add a picture watermark,"Let's add a picturewatermark behind this text, but this time instead of putting it on the slide master, we'll add it to the slide itself andthen copy it to another slide.Keep in mind that if you want the watermark on more than just a few slides, it makes more sense to use the slide master because it saves you fromhaving to manually copy the watermark.Go to the Insert tab,click Shapes and select a rectangle, then draw it on this slide.On the Drawing tools formattab click Shape outline and click No outline,then click Shape fill and Picture. Browse for the picture you wantand click Insert. We're adding the picture to the Fill property of the shapeinstead of directly to the slide because this way wehave more options to work withincluding Transparency.By default, the picturestretches to fill the shape, to get it to the right aspectratio, go to the Picture tools format tab, click Crop and then click Fitand drag the Crop Handles to cropout the empty space around the picture.Click Crop again to turn it off.Now we can press Shift anddrag the corner handles toresize the picture withoutchanging the aspect ratio and then move the picture into place.Next we need to tweak the formatting to make the picture work as a watermark. First click Send backward and Send to back.Then click the Format shape dialogbox launcher and the Fill in line tab.Add transparency untilthe foreground elements are clearly visible but make sure it's not so transparent the viewer won't know what the picture is.Watermark pictures aretricky because you have to find an image that is easily recognizable but doesn't fight for dominance with the foreground elements.You'll want to avoid imageswith lots of fine detail and images like this will take too mucheffort for the viewer to figure out.This picture of kid worksbecause the viewer will knowimmediately what it is and how itrelates but it contains a lot of detail.So we can use these optionsto reduce some detail so the image will blend inbetter with the background.On the Picture tab,you can try Brightness andContrast and Color optionslike Saturation and Recolor.Also try usingSharpness to remove detail.The Effects tab has artistic effects.For this picture, let's addthe Line drawing effect and increase the pencil size.Click away from the pictureto get a better idea of how everything lookswithout the selection border.If you find you can'tselect the picture again becauseit's behind other objects,go to the Home tab, click Select and open the Selection pane.Now you can select thepicture by clicking it in the list.So once you're happy withthe watermark, you can save itas a picture andinsert it in other slides.Or you can simplycopy it to the clipboard.Move to anotherslide and then paste it.Right click the picture andsend it to the back layer.Now let's say we decide wewant to change the look of our presentation, by going to the Design tab and applying a theme like Ion for example.As you can see, your choiceof watermark picture dependsgreatly on the designyou choose for your slides.In this case all we needto do is adjust the picturesettings to help it blend inwith the design but you may need to find a new picture.Also since we didn't use the slide master, we'll need to copy the finished picture to the other slides manually.So now you know how to addtext to picture watermarks.",let add picturewatermark behind text time instead put slide master well add slide andthen copi anoth slidekeep mind want watermark slide make sens use slide master save fromhav manual copi watermarkgo insert tabclick shape select rectangl draw slideon draw tool formattab click shape outlin click outlinethen click shape fill pictur brows pictur wantand click insert ad pictur fill properti shapeinstead directli slide way wehav option work withinclud transparencybi default picturestretch fill shape get right aspectratio go pictur tool format tab click crop click fitand drag crop handl cropout empti space around pictureclick crop turn offnow press shift anddrag corner handl tores pictur withoutchang aspect ratio move pictur placenext need tweak format make pictur work watermark first click send backward send backthen click format shape dialogbox launcher fill line tabadd transpar untilth foreground element clearli visibl make sure transpar viewer wont know pictur iswatermark pictur aretricki find imag easili recogniz doesnt fight domin foreground elementsyoul want avoid imageswith lot fine detail imag like take mucheffort viewer figur outthi pictur kid worksbecaus viewer knowimmedi itrel contain lot detailso use optionsto reduc detail imag blend inbett backgroundon pictur tabyou tri bright andcontrast color optionslik satur recoloralso tri usingsharp remov detailth effect tab artist effectsfor pictur let addth line draw effect increas pencil sizeclick away pictureto get better idea everyth lookswithout select borderif find cantselect pictur becauseit behind objectsgo home tab click select open select panenow select thepictur click listso your happi withth watermark save ita pictur andinsert slidesor simplycopi clipboardmov anotherslid past itright click pictur andsend back layernow let say decid wewant chang look present go design tab appli theme like ion examplea see choiceof watermark pictur dependsgreatli designy choos slidesin case needto adjust pictureset help blend inwith design may need find new picturealso sinc didnt use slide master well need copi finish pictur slide manuallyso know addtext pictur watermark
Remove a watermark,"Have you ever run into aroadblock when you couldn't figure out how to remove a watermarkbecause you couldn't find where it was?Well now you should have all theinformation you need to track it down.First, determine which slide it's on; if it's on just one or two slides, it might beburied in a background layer.Click the Home tab, clickSelect and open the selection pane.Click the Show/hidebutton for each object.If you find the watermark, youcan leave it hidden or press Delete.If you don't see it on theslide, check the slide master.Go to the View taband click Slide master.If you see the watermark on all ofthe layouts, click the slide master.If you don't see it on the slide master, then check the layouts individually.Again, go through theobjects using the Selection paneand the Show/hide buttons and if you find it, Deleteit or keep it hidden.If you don't find it on theslide master or individual layouts, then the last place to look is the background.Close the slide master,then click the Designtab and Format background.Click Solid fill, if the watermark goes away that means it was inserted as a picture by clicking Picture or texture fill.If your slides use abackground color, you'll also noticethat it changes and some otherbackground elements might go away.This is because thewatermark was incorporated with the color and other elements in one picture file and now there's no way to separate them.However, you can rightclick the image and click Save background, then you can Edit the file in an image editing program or you can click File and replace thepicture with something else.So now you have all theinformation you need to add orremove watermarks in PowerPoint.",ever run aroadblock couldnt figur remov watermarkbecaus couldnt find waswel theinform need track downfirst determin slide one two slide might beburi background layerclick home tab clickselect open select paneclick showhidebutton objectif find watermark youcan leav hidden press deleteif dont see theslid check slide mastergo view taband click slide masterif see watermark ofth layout click slide masterif dont see slide master check layout individuallyagain go theobject use select paneand showhid button find deleteit keep hiddenif dont find theslid master individu layout last place look backgroundclos slide masterthen click designtab format backgroundclick solid fill watermark goe away mean insert pictur click pictur textur fillif slide use abackground color youll also noticethat chang otherbackground element might go awaythi thewatermark incorpor color element one pictur file there way separ themhowev rightclick imag click save background edit file imag edit program click file replac thepictur someth elseso theinform need add orremov watermark powerpoint
Design motion paths,"You're probably familiarwith animation effects like these where you fade in a list, line by line or you fade in pictures one by one,but say you want a sequencewhere pictures fade in andthen move somewhere on the slidelike the first two pictures here.I'll play this effect again.The first pictureenters and moves left.The second oneenters and moves right.The pictures are moved byanimation effects called motion paths.A motion path moves an item likea picture on a line you specify.Let's apply a motion path, I've put aFade entrance effect on this picture.Next I want it to move to the left,not to exit but just to change position.I'll apply a motion path,with the picture selected I click Add animation and I find Motion paths at the bottom of the gallery. I want a Straight line.Once I apply the path, I can use Effect options to make changes to it like changing its direction.I can choose a Startsetting for the path and a Duration. Let's look at a preview.The picture fades in andmoves to the left on the path;so you use a motion pathto move something in a very specific way on a slide. You can also combine motion paths with other effects.In this example a line motion path is combined with the Spin effect to make thewheels seem like it's rolling.Here a rocket imagetraveling on motion paths get smallerin the distance andlarger on its return.It's moving on diagonal paths thathave a Grow/shrink effect applied.Motion paths help youdo more with animation.In this list, the chevronarrow moves bullet to bullet ona series of Down motion pathssetting off text effects as it moves.Coming up, we'll apply andcustomize motion paths andcreate effects that areboth practical and fun.",your probabl familiarwith anim effect like fade list line line fade pictur one onebut say want sequencewher pictur fade andthen move somewher slidelik first two pictur hereil play effect againth first pictureent move leftth second oneent move rightth pictur move byanim effect call motion pathsa motion path move item likea pictur line specifylet appli motion path ive put afad entranc effect picturenext want move leftnot exit chang positionil appli motion pathwith pictur select click add anim find motion path bottom galleri want straight lineonc appli path use effect option make chang like chang directioni choos startset path durat let look previewth pictur fade andmov left pathso use motion pathto move someth specif way slide also combin motion path effectsin exampl line motion path combin spin effect make thewheel seem like rollingher rocket imagetravel motion path get smallerin distanc andlarg returnit move diagon path thathav growshrink effect appliedmot path help youdo animationin list chevronarrow move bullet bullet ona seri motion pathsset text effect movescom well appli andcustom motion path andcreat effect areboth practic fun
Work with a motion path,"To cover the basics of Motion paths, let's start with this animation effect :a wheel that rolls back and forth.In this movie I'll focus oncreating the Motion path for the effect so you can seehow to work with a path.In Movie 3, I'll apply aspin and other effects to the wheel to complete the rolling effect.Here's the wheel imagewith no effects applied,to apply the Motion pathI select the wheel and on the Animations tab I open the Effects Gallery and scroll down to Motion paths. There are these paths and down at the very bottom there's a link to more.A Straight Line path is most common and that's what I want so I'll choose it. The Path effect plays in the auto preview and it's a downward path by default.On the path, the greencircle shows the starting point for the line, the red circle shows the ending point.This paler image of the wheelshows you where it will end up.When you see the ghosted image and the start and end points are little circles,you know the path is selected.When I click anywhere that isn'ton the path that deselects the path.When the path isn't selected, the starting and ending points are a greenarrow and a red arrow.For my wheel animation effect I wanta right pointing path not a down one.The easiest way to fix thatis to first select the Path,point to it and look forthe 4 pointed cursor, then click, then I'll open Effect Options and here are more types of straight paths.I'll choose Right, thewheel now moves to the rightand its arrows point to the right.I want to make this pathlonger so I'm going to resize it.First I select it, then I'm going to press the Shift key to keep the line horizontal as I drag it.With the Shift key down, I point to the end of the pathand when I see this 2 pointedsizing cursor I drag the mouse.I want the wheel to stop about here so I'll let up the mouse button and Shift key.Now let's preview the effect, the path moves the wheel straight to the right to the end of the bar.dragging to size the path, I can move it in any direction I want too.Earlier I could have changedits direction by dragging it from down to right. It's just a little trickier when you draw to get the line perfectly horizontal.",cover basic motion path let start anim effect wheel roll back forthin movi ill focu oncreat motion path effect seehow work pathin movi 3 ill appli aspin effect wheel complet roll effecther wheel imagewith effect appliedto appli motion pathi select wheel anim tab open effect galleri scroll motion path path bottom there link morea straight line path common that want ill choos path effect play auto preview downward path defaulton path greencircl show start point line red circl show end pointthi paler imag wheelshow end upwhen see ghost imag start end point littl circlesy know path selectedwhen click anywher isnton path deselect pathwhen path isnt select start end point greenarrow red arrowfor wheel anim effect wanta right point path oneth easiest way fix thati first select pathpoint look forth 4 point cursor click ill open effect option type straight pathsil choos right thewheel move rightand arrow point righti want make pathlong im go resiz itfirst select im go press shift key keep line horizont drag itwith shift key point end pathand see 2 pointeds cursor drag mousei want wheel stop ill let mous button shift keynow let preview effect path move wheel straight right end bardrag size path move direct want tooearlier could changedit direct drag right littl trickier draw get line perfectli horizont
Combine a path with other effects,"A motion path can beespecially powerful when you combine it with another animation effect.For example, this wheel image has a motion path that moves it to the right, but I can get a better result,more natural motion if I adda spin effect to the wheel.To add the spin effect, I'll selectthe wheel and then click Add animation.animation rather than going tothe main effects gallery because the wheel already has one effect, the motion path.I'm adding to that one, soin the Add animation gallery I look in the Emphasiseffects and choose Spin.Let's preview all the effects.The wheel moves to theright and then spins, but I want it to spin while itmoves along the path.To work more with the spin,I'll open the Animation pane.The spin emphasis effect isyellow and has the star iconand the motion path isblue and has the line icon.I'll select the spineffect and click its arrow and instead of having it Start onclick I'll have it Start with previous.Now let's click Play allto preview the sequence.The wheel rolls, but noticehow it starts rolling beforeit moves and keepsrolling after it's stopped.To make the spin lookmore natural, I'll select it,display its menu andclick Effect options.I use these settings, Smooth start and Smooth end to control the spin - they give the spin a more gradual start and end.I'll set each one toone second and click OK.I'll click Play all. Now the roll looks more natural and the wheel doesn't spin in place.Last I want the wheel toroll back and forth, so I'm going to select both effects. I'll click one, press control and click the other.With both effects selected, there's just one arrow toclick for the drop down menu and whatI select will apply to both effects.I'll click Effect options and select this option, Auto reverse. This will make both effects play and then play again in reverse.Now while I've got thedialog box open, I'm going toclick the Timing tab and speedup the duration of both effects.I'll change this from 2 seconds to 1.5. Another thing I can do ismake the whole effect repeatby clicking 2 in the repeat box.There's the finished effect, the wheel rolls back and forth and it repeats.Here's another animationsequence that uses combined effects.This rocket moves on twodiagonal motion paths, one to the Moon and one back to Earth.I'll play the sequence.The rocket flies to the Moonthen turns around and flies back.You'll also notice that the rocket gets smaller as it moves away and larger as it returns.That's the work of aneffect called grow/shrink.It's combined with the motion paths.Here are the effectsin the animation pane.These are the motion pathsand each one is followed bythis emphasis effectcalled grow/shrink.Each grow/shrink effect is set toplay with the previous motion path.So let's look at the firstuse of the grow/shrink effect.I'll open its effect options.In this case the grow/shrinkeffect applies to the rocketas it moves away, so itssize is set to smaller which makes the rocket shrink; also its smooth start setting delays the shrinking so it happens away down the path or farther away and the smooth end setting helps the shrinking effect at the end of the path to occur gradually.Now here's the othergrow/shrink effect.Let's open its effect options.This effect applies to therocket on its return motion path, so the rocketsize is doubled at 200% and its smooth start and smoothend settings are adjusted tomake the rocket get largergradually as it returns on the motion path.So, with motion paths, remember there's power in combinations.",motion path beespeci power combin anoth anim effectfor exampl wheel imag motion path move right get better resultmor natur motion adda spin effect wheelto add spin effect ill selectth wheel click add animationanim rather go toth main effect galleri wheel alreadi one effect motion pathim ad one soin add anim galleri look emphasiseffect choos spinlet preview effectsth wheel move theright spin want spin itmov along pathto work spinil open anim paneth spin emphasi effect isyellow star iconand motion path isblu line iconil select spineffect click arrow instead start onclick ill start previousnow let click play allto preview sequenceth wheel roll noticehow start roll beforeit move keepsrol stoppedto make spin lookmor natur ill select itdisplay menu andclick effect optionsi use set smooth start smooth end control spin give spin gradual start endil set one toon second click okil click play roll look natur wheel doesnt spin placelast want wheel torol back forth im go select effect ill click one press control click otherwith effect select there one arrow toclick drop menu whati select appli effectsil click effect option select option auto revers make effect play play reversenow ive got thedialog box open im go toclick time tab speedup durat effectsil chang 2 second 15 anoth thing ismak whole effect repeatbi click 2 repeat boxther finish effect wheel roll back forth repeatsher anoth animationsequ use combin effectsthi rocket move twodiagon motion path one moon one back earthil play sequenceth rocket fli moonthen turn around fli backyoul also notic rocket get smaller move away larger returnsthat work aneffect call growshrinkit combin motion pathsher effectsin anim panethes motion pathsand one follow bythi emphasi effectcal growshrinkeach growshrink effect set toplay previou motion pathso let look firstus growshrink effectil open effect optionsin case growshrinkeffect appli rocketa move away itssiz set smaller make rocket shrink also smooth start set delay shrink happen away path farther away smooth end set help shrink effect end path occur graduallynow here othergrowshrink effectlet open effect optionsthi effect appli therocket return motion path rockets doubl 200 smooth start smoothend set adjust tomak rocket get largergradu return motion pathso motion path rememb there power combin
Create a sequence with line paths,"In this list an arrowhelps create visual impact.With each mouse click thearrow moves down the listpunctuating and lightingup the text as it goes.Motion paths make thisby driving the arrow down bullet tobullet and triggering the text effects.A sequence like this is fairly simple to create, but it may not look that way. I'm going to recreate it now to show you more techniques for using motion paths and animation.Here's the list withno animations applied.For this exercise, I've zoomed in for a close up view and I'll turn off Auto Preview.First I'll apply the motion paths.The paths go on this chevron arrow; for the first path, I select the arrow, open theAnimation Gallery and choose Lines. A down path is applied and that's what I want.The pale image of the chevron arrow shows me where the arrow will move to, but I want it to stop at the second bullet, so I need to shorten the path.I press Shift to keep theline vertical as I redraw it,then point to the end, look for the two headed arrow and drag the end upward.As I drag, note thiscrosshairs that appears.It helps me visually to line upthe end of the path with the bullet.I release the mouse andShift key and click away.There's the first path.Let's preview it. The arrow stops at the second bullet.I need three more motionpaths for the chevron arrow.For the next one, I select the arrow again and this time I click Add Animation sincethe arrow already has one path.In that gallery, I choose Lines again.The second path is applied and it'sthe one that's currently selected.Remember that the selectedpath always has red and green circles rather than arrows at the start and end.I need to resize this new path to gobetween the second and third bullets.I press Shift to keep the line vertical, then I point to the green circle at the start of the path, look for the two headed arrow cursor and drag the starting point to the second bullet.I let up the mouse and Shift key.The starting point forthe second path is now here.The end point needs tobe at the third bullet.The path is still selectedso I press Shift and drag upthe end of the pathto the third bullet.I now have two motionpaths for the chevron arrow.Let's preview how this plays.The arrow moves down in two steps tothe second bullet and third bullet.That's exactly what I want.So to add more paths, I select the chevron, use Add Animation to apply the path and then resize the path.Now the animation pane can helpwith this process, so let's open it.Here are the motionpaths I've added so far.Notice how when I selectthe first path effect in the pane, that path is alsoselected on the slide.I select the second path effect in the pane and it's selected on the slideand there's the third path.Another detail is that forthe paths that start below the chevron, they're shown with a pale image of the chevron at the start and end.So, as I'm resizing these layered paths, I can select themin the animation pane if I want to.Now I've got all themotion paths in place.Before I preview them, I wantto adjust their playing time.A quick way is to select them all.I'll click the bottom one, press Shift and click the top one to select the range, then I'll change the duration setting up here.Instead of two secondsI'll decrease this to .75. Notice how the durationbox that's in the Animation pane shorten as I decrease the number.To watch the sequence,I'll click Play selected.The arrow moves downand stops at each bullet.I'll complete the animationsequence by adding a text effect.I want the effect to turnthis text from gray to white.I'll select the placeholderand in the Animation Gallery, I'll choose an Emphasis effect called the Brush Color.Now I'll open EffectOptions for the group.I want the effect to turn the text white, so I'll change this blue color to white.Also I want to animate the text by word instead of letter, so I'll choose By word.To see just the texteffect, I'll click Play Selected;the text highlights line by line.My last task is to reorder the motion paths so they play between the text effects.I'll select the first motion path and drag it down underthe first text line which is ""Location"". Then I'll do that with the rest of the paths in order, so the second one goes under ""Time"".The third one goes under ""Dress code"" and the fourth one follows ""What to bring"".Another thing is, I want the text effects to play automatically after each path, so I'll press Ctrl and click to select each text effect that follows a path.I'll set these to Start after previous. Let's click Play All to play the full sequence.A final detail: in theoriginal sequence, the arrow flew in and lit up the first line.That's done with a Fly Inentrance effect on the arrowordered at the start of the sequence.",list arrowhelp creat visual impactwith mous click thearrow move listpunctu lightingup text goesmot path make thisbi drive arrow bullet tobullet trigger text effectsa sequenc like fairli simpl creat may look way im go recreat show techniqu use motion path animationher list withno anim appliedfor exercis ive zoom close view ill turn auto previewfirst ill appli motion pathsth path go chevron arrow first path select arrow open theanim galleri choos line path appli that wantth pale imag chevron arrow show arrow move want stop second bullet need shorten pathi press shift keep thelin vertic redraw itthen point end look two head arrow drag end upwarda drag note thiscrosshair appearsit help visual line upth end path bulleti releas mous andshift key click awayther first pathlet preview arrow stop second bulleti need three motionpath chevron arrowfor next one select arrow time click add anim sinceth arrow alreadi one pathin galleri choos line againth second path appli itsth one that current selectedrememb selectedpath alway red green circl rather arrow start endi need resiz new path gobetween second third bulletsi press shift keep line vertic point green circl start path look two head arrow cursor drag start point second bulleti let mous shift keyth start point forth second path hereth end point need tobe third bulletth path still selectedso press shift drag upth end pathto third bulleti two motionpath chevron arrowlet preview playsth arrow move two step toth second bullet third bulletthat exactli wantso add path select chevron use add anim appli path resiz pathnow anim pane helpwith process let open ither motionpath ive ad farnotic selectth first path effect pane path alsoselect slidei select second path effect pane select slideand there third pathanoth detail forth path start chevron theyr shown pale imag chevron start endso im resiz layer path select themin anim pane want tonow ive got themot path placebefor preview wantto adjust play timea quick way select allil click bottom one press shift click top one select rang ill chang durat set hereinstead two secondsil decreas 75 notic durationbox that anim pane shorten decreas numberto watch sequenceil click play selectedth arrow move downand stop bulletil complet animationsequ ad text effecti want effect turnthi text gray whiteil select placeholderand anim galleri ill choos emphasi effect call brush colornow ill open effectopt groupi want effect turn text white ill chang blue color whitealso want anim text word instead letter ill choos wordto see texteffect ill click play selectedth text highlight line linemi last task reorder motion path play text effectsil select first motion path drag underth first text line locat ill rest path order second one goe timeth third one goe dress code fourth one follow bringanoth thing want text effect play automat path ill press ctrl click select text effect follow pathil set start previou let click play play full sequencea final detail theorigin sequenc arrow flew lit first linethat done fli inentr effect arroword start sequenc
Apply paths to layered pictures,"In movie 1, the course introduction, we played this animation sequence inwhich pictures fade in at the center and then move leftand right on motion paths.A tricky part of the sequence is that the pictures are stacked in front of each other.How do you apply motion paths orother effects to the items you can't see?I'm going to show yousome tools that help.Let's look at theslide at an earlier stage.I've started by positioning everything where I want it to end up on the slide and applying the Fade entrance effectusing the order I want.Now I'll stack the pictures in thecenter and then apply the motion paths.I'll close theAnimation pane for now.When I stack things I likecontrolling the front to back order, so for Holly's picture which appears first, I'll right click andchoose Bring to front.Remember these commands,they're useful when you want tomove something behind or forward.For Lola's picture I'll choose Send backward, so she'll stack behind Holly and for Mark's picture I'll choose Send to back which puts him at the back.There's a quick way tostack and center the pictures.First, I'll select them all.I'm pressing Ctrl as Iclick, then in Picture tools, I'll click Align objects.This is a great set ofcommands for positioning things.I want to align selectedobjects relative to each otherrather than to the slideand that's checked here.Then I'll click Align center - that both stacks and centers the pictures.One thing I did to preparethe pictures was to crop them all to be the same sizeso they would stack evenly.Now I'll open the next handytool which is the Selection pane; it's also partof the Picture tools.The Selection pane listsevery item on the slide;pictures, captions andthe title placeholder.The pictures are currentlyselected on the slide andthey're also selected in the pane.I can select items on the slide byselecting them in the Selection pane.Holly's caption selectsthat shape on the slide, Lola's caption selects that shape,Title selects the title placeholder.Another thing I can do is nameeach item so it's descriptive.PowerPoint uses names like""placeholder 5"" or ""rectangle 3"" but you can doubleclick and retype what you want.But the real benefit of theSelection pane is that I canuse these icons shaped like aneye to hide things on the slide.So for example, if I wantto work just with Lola's picture, I can point to theeye next to Holly's pictureand click it and thathides Holly and shows Lola.To re-display Holly, I click the icon again.This will help meadd the motion paths.Holly's picture's in frontso I can easily add her path.I can select her pictureby clicking in the pane.I click Animations, Add animation because Holly already has a fade effect and Lines.There's the path and it's selected.Using Effect options,I'll make it go to the left.Now to work with Lola'spicture, I'm going to hide Holly.In the Selection pane,I'll close the eye for Holly's picture and now I canwork with Lola's picture.I select the picture, clickAdd animation, apply the pathand make it a right pointing path.That takes care of themotion paths and very important, I have to remember to re-displayHolly's picture in the Selection pane.So to recap, three toolsthat helped me work with layeredpictures were the arrangecommands such as Bring to front, the Align commands in Picture toolsand the Selection panealso in Picture tools.I can close the Selection pane now.Now I just need toorder the animation effects.I'll open the Animationpane and do that quickly.Here are the motion paths.I'll drag the one forHolly's picture up to follow the entrance of her pictureand I'll do the same with the motion path for Lola's picture.I'll drag it up to followthe entrance of her picture.I'll set them both to Start after previous so they move on the path after they enter.While they're selected,I'll change their duration andmake it shorter at one second and finally I'll click Play allto see the sequence.Now you have all thetools you need to create great animations using motion paths.",movi 1 cours introduct play anim sequenc inwhich pictur fade center move leftand right motion pathsa tricki part sequenc pictur stack front otherhow appli motion path oroth effect item cant seeim go show yousom tool helplet look theslid earlier stageiv start posit everyth want end slide appli fade entranc effectus order wantnow ill stack pictur thecent appli motion pathsil close theanim pane nowwhen stack thing likecontrol front back order holli pictur appear first ill right click andchoos bring frontrememb commandstheyr use want tomov someth behind forwardfor lola pictur ill choos send backward shell stack behind holli mark pictur ill choos send back put backther quick way tostack center picturesfirst ill select allim press ctrl iclick pictur tool ill click align objectsthi great set ofcommand posit thingsi want align selectedobject rel otherrath slideand that check herethen ill click align center stack center pictureson thing prepareth pictur crop sizeso would stack evenlynow ill open next handytool select pane also partof pictur toolsth select pane listseveri item slidepictur caption andth titl placeholderth pictur currentlyselect slide andtheyr also select panei select item slide byselect select paneholli caption selectsthat shape slide lola caption select shapetitl select titl placeholderanoth thing nameeach item descriptivepowerpoint use name likeplacehold 5 rectangl 3 doubleclick retyp wantbut real benefit theselect pane canus icon shape like aney hide thing slideso exampl wantto work lola pictur point theey next holli pictureand click thathid holli show lolato redisplay holli click icon againthi help meadd motion pathsholli pictur frontso easili add pathi select picturebi click panei click anim add anim holli alreadi fade effect linesther path selectedus effect optionsil make go leftnow work lolaspictur im go hide hollyin select paneil close eye holli pictur canwork lola picturei select pictur clickadd anim appli pathand make right point paththat take care themot path import rememb redisplayholli pictur select paneso recap three toolsthat help work layeredpictur arrangecommand bring front align command pictur toolsand select panealso pictur toolsi close select pane nownow need toorder anim effectsil open animationpan quicklyher motion pathsil drag one forholli pictur follow entranc pictureand ill motion path lola pictureil drag followth entranc pictureil set start previou move path enterwhil theyr selectedil chang durat andmak shorter one second final ill click play allto see sequencenow thetool need creat great anim use motion path
Use slide masters to customize a presentation,"When you want to fullycustomize the design of a presentation, using not only your own background design and colors but also uniquefont colors, picture bullets,varied background designsand customized slide layouts,turn to the slide master.Use the slide master tomake global design changes andcreate exactly thelook and layouts you need.To work on this slide master,click the View tab, Slide master.This opens Slide master view which contains the slide master and master layouts.The slide master is the largerthumbnail at the top in the thumbnail pane.The smaller thumbnails below it areall the layouts that go with the master.The slide master containsall the design elements foryour slides including thebackground design - in this example it's plain white - font styles, color scheme, types of placeholders, even the bullet design for lists.To make a design change forthe whole presentation such as changing the title fontcolor, change the slide master.Let's make it a rust color.The change applies to every layout.At the same time, thebenefit of the layouts is that I can customize them individually. So for example, I can give this title slide layout a different title font colorsuch as blue and the changeapplies only to that layout.Switching to normal view,  I see that the title slide has the blue font color and theother slides have the rust color.So the master layouts let me make design changes apart from the slide master. Also I can create exactly the type of layout I want. In Slide master view I click the Insert layout command and get a brand new layout.Then I use Insert placeholder to choose a placeholder type and draw it on the layout.Using Rename layout, I'll give the layout its own name and save it.In normal view, when Iinsert a new slide, the custom layout is availablein the Layout gallery.Back in slide master view, I'll also rename the customized slide master.When I'm editing in normal view, it's easy to find my customized design in the themes gallery.If I save it as a theme then it's always available for me to apply from the gallery.Slide masters let me do more; if I need one set of slidesto be completely different from the rest, I can insertanother slide master and then customize it with itsown design and layouts.",want fullycustom design present use background design color also uniquefont color pictur bulletsvari background designsand custom slide layoutsturn slide masterus slide master tomak global design chang andcreat exactli thelook layout needto work slide masterclick view tab slide masterthi open slide master view contain slide master master layoutsth slide master largerthumbnail top thumbnail paneth smaller thumbnail areal layout go masterth slide master containsal design element foryour slide includ thebackground design exampl plain white font style color scheme type placehold even bullet design liststo make design chang forth whole present chang titl fontcolor chang slide masterlet make rust colorth chang appli everi layoutat time thebenefit layout custom individu exampl give titl slide layout differ titl font colorsuch blue changeappli layoutswitch normal view see titl slide blue font color theother slide rust colorso master layout let make design chang apart slide master also creat exactli type layout want slide master view click insert layout command get brand new layoutthen use insert placehold choos placehold type draw layoutus renam layout ill give layout name save itin normal view iinsert new slide custom layout availablein layout galleryback slide master view ill also renam custom slide masterwhen im edit normal view easi find custom design theme galleryif save theme alway avail appli galleryslid master let need one set slidesto complet differ rest insertanoth slide master custom itsown design layout
Customize the slide master,"Though I've added a fewslides here for demonstration purposes, it's really idealto customize the slide masterand get all your design changes inplace before you add any slide content.You can start with any ofthe PowerPoint themes, but I like the Office themebecause it has the least amount ofdesign already applied.That's what PowerPoint uses for a blank presentation.Let's open the slide master.To get there, click theView tab, Slide master; here's the slide master, thisbigger thumbnail at the top.And these are the layoutsthat go with the master.A feature of this viewis the Slide master tab.It supports all your editingof the slide master and layouts.On the slide master thumbnail, a tiptells you the name of the master - here it's the Office themed slide master- and which slides are using it.Since this is the only master in the presentation, all the slides are using it.On each layout, you get a similar tip, the name of the layout which tells you its type and whether anyslides are using it.To customize the slide master,first make sure it's selected.The changes I make to it Iwant to apply to every slide.I'll start with a background design: Background styles on the Slide master tab, Format background - there's a picture I want to use as afill, so I click Picture or texture fill and then Fileand select the picture file.The background gets applied tothe master and all the layouts.Now let's find a color schemethat complements the background.Clicking Colors shows allthe possible combinations.The Office theme colorsare currently applied.Looking for a set that goes with the pale green background image; how about this group called Orange?I'll use this new color scheme forthe slide text starting with titles.On the slide master, I'llselect the title placeholderand click the Home tab then Font color which shows the colors of the new scheme.How about one of these dark oranges?That one change applies toevery heading in the master layouts.Now let's change the body text color.On the slide master, Iselect that placeholder, click Font color and choose acomplementary color, Dark green,that applies to anybody text in the layouts.So we've got a custombackground and font colors.How about using art forthe list bullets?To do that select the body textplaceholder and click the Bullets menu.There click Bullets andNumbering at the bottom then Picture and browsefor a picture file.I'll zoom way in soyou can see the image.It's a little bird ofparadise flower; that's what all the bullets will now look like.For the last design change on the master, we'll adjust the width of the body textplaceholder and the text spacing in it.A placeholder is a shape,so I'll right click it andclick Format shape, then under Shape options, I'll click Size and Properties and then click Size.On the width box, let's reducethe width by a couple of inches.We can center it onthe slide in a minute.To change textspacing, click Text Box.I want a little more spacearound the text, so I'll bump up the margins forit in the placeholder.To center the placeholdereven more, let's use the Align commands and click Align center - the body text is now more centered on the slide which I like given the wide screen slide format.These changes affectthe layouts with body text placeholders such as title andcontent and the two column layouts.It's time to give ourcustomized master its own name, so right clicking it, we'll chooseRename master and call it Fabrikam Theme.Let's see how thesechanges look on our slides; I'll click Normal to open normal view.There's the background, the two font colors are applied to title and body text, the body text is more centeredand there are the picture bullets.",though ive ad fewslid demonstr purpos realli idealto custom slide masterand get design chang inplac add slide contenty start ofth powerpoint theme like offic themebecaus least amount ofdesign alreadi appliedthat powerpoint use blank presentationlet open slide masterto get click theview tab slide master here slide master thisbigg thumbnail topand layoutsthat go mastera featur viewi slide master tabit support editingof slide master layoutson slide master thumbnail tiptel name master offic theme slide master slide use itsinc master present slide use iton layout get similar tip name layout tell type whether anyslid use itto custom slide masterfirst make sure selectedth chang make iwant appli everi slideil start background design background style slide master tab format background there pictur want use afil click pictur textur fill fileand select pictur fileth background get appli toth master layoutsnow let find color schemethat complement backgroundclick color show allth possibl combinationsth offic theme colorsar current appliedlook set goe pale green background imag group call orangeil use new color scheme forth slide text start titleson slide master illselect titl placeholderand click home tab font color show color new schemehow one dark orangesthat one chang appli toeveri head master layoutsnow let chang bodi text coloron slide master iselect placehold click font color choos acomplementari color dark greenthat appli anybodi text layoutsso weve got custombackground font colorshow use art forth list bulletsto select bodi textplacehold click bullet menuther click bullet andnumb bottom pictur browsefor pictur fileil zoom way soyou see imageit littl bird ofparadis flower that bullet look likefor last design chang master well adjust width bodi textplacehold text space ita placehold shapeso ill right click andclick format shape shape option ill click size properti click sizeon width box let reduceth width coupl inchesw center onth slide minuteto chang textspac click text boxi want littl spacearound text ill bump margin forit placeholderto center placeholdereven let use align command click align center bodi text center slide like given wide screen slide formatthes chang affectth layout bodi text placehold titl andcont two column layoutsit time give ourcustom master name right click well chooserenam master call fabrikam themelet see thesechang look slide ill click normal open normal viewther background two font color appli titl bodi text bodi text centeredand pictur bullet
Customize master layouts,"Let's do more withcustomizing the slide master bycustomizing master layouts.One thing you'll see is that PowerPoint provides many default layouts, probably more than you'll need.To delete a layout you don'tneed, select it and press Delete.This simplifies what you're working with and helps keep the file size smaller. currently applied to any slides like this title slide layout or this title and content layout, you can't delete it.If it turns out you need oneof the deleted layouts, you can click Insert slidemaster to get a new blank master.Then you can copy one ofthe original layouts and paste it under the customized master andit takes on all the master attributes.So these are thelayouts I want to keep.The two layouts we'llcustomize first are the title slide layout and the section header layout.Let's move up the section header layout just to group it with the title layout.I'm going to use aslightly different background for these, so I'll select them, click Background styles and Format background; Picture or texture Fill is already selected in the Format background pane, and I'll click File to choose the picture.This image is just a little bit brighter than the slide master's background and now the title and section header slides are unique.For the title slide layout, let'smake its title font color different too.With the placeholderselected, I click the Home tab andchange the font color to dark green.I'd also like to increase thesubtitle font size up to 32.For the section header layout, I'll leave the title font color as it is, but the subtitle font I'll change to match the body text and other subtitles - dark green, and I'll increase its point size to 28.Let's switch to normal viewand have a look at these changes.They've been applied forthe appropriate layouts.Here's the title slide withthe new brighter background,title color changeand larger subtitle.And here's the section headers slide - it has the new background and the subtitle font changes.Keep in mind that if you'vealready made design changesto a slide in normal view and then you change the master layout that's applied to it, you'll need to reapply the layout in normal view to get the latest changes.Turning back to slide master view, here's a handy keyboard shortcut you can use to open the view.Press Shift as youclick the Normal button.Now let's create an original layout.There's the option on the Slidemaster tab to insert a blank layout.I could start from that,but the layout I imagine is a lot like this picture with caption layout.I'll use that as mystarting point; with that layout selected, I'll press Ctrl-D to duplicate it and we'll adapt this to a layoutfor customer testimonials.First, I want to deletethis picture placeholder, I'll select it and press Delete.Then we click Insert placeholder.The content for thisplaceholder will be video so we'll choose Media for the type ofplaceholder and draw the placeholder.Looks like it's formattedto have a bullet and I don't want that so I'll click the Home tab, Bullets and choose None.I also want a specialheading above the video placeholder, so let's click the Insert tab, Text boxand draw a text box.It should say ""Testimonials"" andlet's make it a little bit bigger.To give the box a colorfill, we'll right click it and choose Format shape, Solid fill, Dark green and I'll drag the transparency slider to lighten it a little. The black text inthe box doesn't show up well.In the Format shape paneI'll click Text options and for the text color change itto white - that's better.To finish the new layoutwe'll right click it, click Rename layout, call it""Testimonials"" and click Rename.Let's apply thelayout in normal view.We'll insert a new slide underthe testimonials section header.I'll click New Slide andthere's the testimonials layout;the new slide gets the new layout.Now I just need toadd my video and text.",let withcustom slide master bycustom master layoutson thing youll see powerpoint provid mani default layout probabl youll needto delet layout dontne select press deletethi simplifi your work help keep file size smaller current appli slide like titl slide layout titl content layout cant delet itif turn need oneof delet layout click insert slidemast get new blank masterthen copi one ofth origin layout past custom master andit take master attributesso thelayout want keepth two layout wellcustom first titl slide layout section header layoutlet move section header layout group titl layoutim go use aslightli differ background ill select click background style format background pictur textur fill alreadi select format background pane ill click file choos picturethi imag littl bit brighter slide master background titl section header slide uniquefor titl slide layout letsmak titl font color differ toowith placeholderselect click home tab andchang font color dark greenid also like increas thesubtitl font size 32for section header layout ill leav titl font color subtitl font ill chang match bodi text subtitl dark green ill increas point size 28let switch normal viewand look changestheyv appli forth appropri layoutsher titl slide withth new brighter backgroundtitl color changeand larger subtitleand here section header slide new background subtitl font changeskeep mind youvealreadi made design changesto slide normal view chang master layout that appli youll need reappli layout normal view get latest changesturn back slide master view here handi keyboard shortcut use open viewpress shift youclick normal buttonnow let creat origin layoutther option slidemast tab insert blank layouti could start thatbut layout imagin lot like pictur caption layoutil use mystart point layout select ill press ctrld duplic well adapt layoutfor custom testimonialsfirst want deletethi pictur placehold ill select press deletethen click insert placeholderth content thisplacehold video well choos media type ofplacehold draw placeholderlook like formattedto bullet dont want ill click home tab bullet choos nonei also want specialhead video placehold let click insert tab text boxand draw text boxit say testimoni andlet make littl bit biggerto give box colorfil well right click choos format shape solid fill dark green ill drag transpar slider lighten littl black text inth box doesnt show wellin format shape paneil click text option text color chang itto white that betterto finish new layoutwel right click click renam layout call ittestimoni click renamelet appli thelayout normal viewwel insert new slide underth testimoni section headeril click new slide andther testimoni layoutth new slide get new layoutnow need toadd video text
Create a new slide master and layouts,"In this presentation, I'vecustomized the Slide masterand various master layoutsand applied those changes to the slides, but after thinking about it, I'd really likethis testimonial section tolook different from the restof the slides with its own layouts.My solution? Create anadditional Slide master for that section.Let's switch to Slide masterview and create a new master.To keep many of the designdetails of the current master,I'll right click the master andchoose Duplicate slide master.The new master getsinserted as number 2.It has the same name asthe original master, Fabrikam theme but with a number 1 in front meaning it's the first copy of the original.Now let's rename it.We'll call it Fabrikam Testimonials,and we'll give it a uniquedesign starting with the background.To remove the currentbackground, I click Background stylesand choose a white background.Instead of a backgroundfill, I'll click the Insert tab,Pictures and insert a picture file.I'll move thepicture all the way left,right click it and choose Send toback to put it behind other content.So, this master has a new look.To customize the layouts,I'll first delete those that I won't need, keeping only the titleslides and the testimonials layout.There are various typesof testimonials from our customers, so first I'mgoing to copy this layout.I'll press Ctrl-Dtwice to duplicate it twiceand we'll make each layout unique.This one will change so itsays Testimonials: Corporate.The second one will beTestimonials: Non-profit, and the third one Testimonials: Personal.Let's vary the text box color too.I'll right click the box,click Format shape and under Fill, choose anothercolor, dark orange.For the non-profit layout,we'll follow the same stepsand choose a lighter brown. So, these are the new customized layouts.Now we'll rename them; foreach we click Rename layoutand change the name.Let's also change thesection header layouts name to Testimonials section header.We'll switch to normal view nowand apply our design and layouts.The Testimonials sectionheader slides still has its original design applied soI'll right click it, point to layout and look for my new layouts.They're grouped under the newmaster Fabrikam Testimonials.I apply thetestimonials section header.Next, this testimonialsslide still has the design andlayout from the originalmaster so I'll open the layout gallery again and choose theTestimonials: Corporate layout.For my other testimonialscontent, I'll insert new slidesand chooseTestimonials: Non-profit and Testimonials:Personal from the gallery.The presentation now hasthe new Testimonials design as well as the original Fabrikam design.To preserve mycustomizations, I have a couple of choices.Let's open the themesgallery on the design tab.Each of my new designsappears in the themes gallery,here's the Fabrikam theme andhere's the Testimonials theme.I can select one of them andchoose Save current theme atthe bottom of the gallery.This will save both designsunder the theme name that I choose and for later presentationsI'll find the theme in the gallery.Another option is to save thecustomized presentation as a template.To do this, you'dclick File, Save as and choose PowerPointtemplate as the file type.This makes it available whenever you click File, New, along with other templates. When you click the Custom category, you'll find theFabrikam template which you can now use as the designfor a new presentation.By customizing Slidemasters, I've created precisely the presentation design andlayouts I need and now you can too.",present ivecustom slide masterand variou master layoutsand appli chang slide think id realli likethi testimoni section tolook differ restof slide layoutsmi solut creat anaddit slide master sectionlet switch slide masterview creat new masterto keep mani designdetail current masteril right click master andchoos duplic slide masterth new master getsinsert number 2it name asth origin master fabrikam theme number 1 front mean first copi originalnow let renam itwel call fabrikam testimonialsand well give uniquedesign start backgroundto remov currentbackground click background stylesand choos white backgroundinstead backgroundfil ill click insert tabpictur insert pictur fileil move thepictur way leftright click choos send toback put behind contentso master new lookto custom layoutsil first delet wont need keep titleslid testimoni layoutther variou typesof testimoni custom first imgo copi layoutil press ctrldtwice duplic twiceand well make layout uniquethi one chang itsay testimoni corporateth second one betestimoni nonprofit third one testimoni personallet vari text box color tooill right click boxclick format shape fill choos anothercolor dark orangefor nonprofit layoutwel follow stepsand choos lighter brown new custom layoutsnow well renam foreach click renam layoutand chang namelet also chang thesect header layout name testimoni section headerwel switch normal view nowand appli design layoutsth testimoni sectionhead slide still origin design appli soill right click point layout look new layoutstheyr group newmast fabrikam testimonialsi appli thetestimoni section headernext testimonialsslid still design andlayout originalmast ill open layout galleri choos thetestimoni corpor layoutfor testimonialscont ill insert new slidesand choosetestimoni nonprofit testimonialsperson galleryth present hasth new testimoni design well origin fabrikam designto preserv mycustom coupl choiceslet open themesgalleri design tabeach new designsappear theme galleryher fabrikam theme andher testimoni themei select one andchoos save current theme atth bottom gallerythi save designsund theme name choos later presentationsil find theme galleryanoth option save thecustom present templateto youdclick file save choos powerpointtempl file typethi make avail whenev click file new along templat click custom categori youll find thefabrikam templat use designfor new presentationbi custom slidemast ive creat precis present design andlayout need
Add a sound effect to a transition,"A transition provides a visual effect when you move from one slide to the next. For example, this transition uses a Honeycomb pattern,another one has more of a glitter effect and others look like a page being flipped or a cube rotating.To enhance a transition,consider adding a sound to itlike this.To give the sound impact,use it selectively such as at the start of a newsection in the slide show.Let's use sound this way.To begin, we click Transitions.I want a transition andsound at the start of each section so I'll pressCtrl and select the first slide under each section heading, Agenda, Values, Impact and Challenges.Now, I'll click More todisplay the transitions galleryand choose the transitioneffect called Honeycomb.The slides with thetransition effect have a little staricon next to the thumbnail. The transition plays from the preceding slide so for the Agenda section, the transition starts on the title slide.I'll click Preview so we can see it.Now we'll add a sound toeach slide that has the transition, I'll press Ctrl while I select the slidesand on the Transitions tab,I'll click the arrow next to Sound.These are built-in soundsI could use such as Breeze,Chime and Drum roll.However, I have my ownsound file so I'll click Other sound. That's the sound file,Space bubbles.wav.I'll click it and click OK.The sound immediatelyplays as a kind of preview.Now let's click Preview to hearthe sound while the transition plays.For the audience, thiscombined effect signals a new section.I'll switch to Slide show view.From the title slide, wetransition to the Agenda which is the first section.Then we move to the Values sectionand we click through that.Let's imagine thatit has more slides.Our next transition isto the Impact sectionand finally the Challenges section.The transition and sound have a purpose and play just enough to be effective.If you want to remove the sound, select eachslide it's applied toand on the Transitionstab, click the Sound arrow,No sound.",transit provid visual effect move one slide next exampl transit use honeycomb patternanoth one glitter effect other look like page flip cube rotatingto enhanc transitionconsid ad sound itlik thisto give sound impactus select start newsect slide showlet use sound wayto begin click transitionsi want transit andsound start section ill pressctrl select first slide section head agenda valu impact challengesnow ill click todisplay transit galleryand choos transitioneffect call honeycombth slide thetransit effect littl staricon next thumbnail transit play preced slide agenda section transit start titl slideil click preview see itnow well add sound toeach slide transit ill press ctrl select slidesand transit tabil click arrow next soundthes builtin soundsi could use breezechim drum rollhowev ownsound file ill click sound that sound filespac bubbleswavil click click okth sound immediatelyplay kind previewnow let click preview hearth sound transit playsfor audienc thiscombin effect signal new sectionil switch slide show viewfrom titl slide wetransit agenda first sectionthen move valu sectionand click thatlet imagin thatit slidesour next transit isto impact sectionand final challeng sectionth transit sound purpos play enough effectiveif want remov sound select eachslid appli toand transitionstab click sound arrowno sound
Add bullets to text,"In PowerPoint, add bulletsto a list of text items toemphasize key points of information.For a list to be most effective, you'll keep that moderate in length and the list items will be brief and scannable.Another aspect of listsconcerns their formatting, font size, line spacing, margins, indentation of ullets and text and bullet type.So as you create bulleted lists, think of their effectiveness in terms of both whatthey say and how they look.Let's go over some list basics.All the content layouts inPowerPoint include bulleted list formatting.To remove the bullets or addthem, you select the content placeholder and click Bullets on the Home tab.To add a new item and dropdown another level press Enterand click Increase listlevel, or press Enter-Tab.To move an item up onelevel, place the insertion pointat the start of the textand click Decrease list levelor press Shift-Tab.Be careful in your use of text levels; for example, this agenda list with first and second level items is much easier for an audience to take in if you limit it to the top level points,as in the list here.As you create a list, you'llwant to work with how it looks.If you want a certaintheme, apply it early on so you know what its list styles look like.Then make other adjustments.To learn more see the othermovies in this course calledChange font size, Linespacing and indentation and Change list formatting on the slide master.",powerpoint add bulletsto list text item toemphas key point informationfor list effect youll keep moder length list item brief scannableanoth aspect listsconcern format font size line space margin indent ullet text bullet typeso creat bullet list think effect term whatthey say looklet go list basicsal content layout inpowerpoint includ bullet list formattingto remov bullet addthem select content placehold click bullet home tabto add new item dropdown anoth level press enterand click increas listlevel press entertabto move item onelevel place insert pointat start textand click decreas list levelor press shifttabb care use text level exampl agenda list first second level item much easier audienc take limit top level pointsa list herea creat list youllwant work looksif want certainthem appli earli know list style look likethen make adjustmentsto learn see othermovi cours calledchang font size linespac indent chang list format slide master
"Change font size, line spacing, and indentation","We've created a bulletedlist for our Agenda slide.Now we'll make some changesto its look and formatting.Since I want to apply adifferent theme to the presentation, I'll do that first. Let's click Design and choose this theme called Facet, that applies different stylesand formatting to the list.So now those are in place upfront.This theme uses a smallfont size for the text.Let's increase it. I'll select the placeholder, click Home, Font size and choose 24.This font size is easier to see andmakes use of the space on the slide. font size for every list in the presentation, you should change it on the slide master.We'll work with the slidemaster in movie 3, Change list formatting on the slide master.We've increased the font size,let's also increase the line spacing.To do that, I'll select the placeholder and on the Home tab, I'll click Line spacingwhere I see that the current setting is 1.0 or single spaced and I see a preview of other settings. I don't want quite so much spacing as 1.5, let's open Line spacing options.This includes settings forindentation as well as spacing.Under spacing, the listis set to single but I can add spaceincrementally in the Before box.I'll change this from 10points to 20 and click OK.So I've added a bit morespace to the single spacing but it's not quite as much as the 1.5 spacing. Now because we've changed font size and line spacing I wantto mention Autofit which can affect both of thesetypes of formatting.To demonstrate Autofit,I'll add 1 more item to this list, watch closely as Itype it: ""Our support"".See how the listadjusted when I started typing?It got more compressed.It will continue to do sowith each additional item.That's the result of Autofit, it adjusts line spacing and font size to fitall list items into the placeholder.We'll delete this last item.Because you may not want the Autofitting, whenever it happens, this controlappears called Autofit options.Let's click it. To undo the autofitting I click Stop fitting text to this placeholder.The line spacing returns towhat it was, I prefer thatso I leave the autofitting undone and let's say I want to turn off Autofit altogether, I click the control again and click Control autocorrect options; in the Autocorrect dialog box, I uncheckAutofit body text to placeholder and click OK.Autofit is now offuntil I turn it back on.Next I want to move the listto the right a little bit to balance out the slide more.To do that, I'll increaseits left margin, I right click the text placeholderand click Format shape.Then I click Size andproperties and Text box.In the Left margin box,I'll change the setting from .1 inch to 1 inch. The text moves to the right as I press the Up arrow for the box.I'll close theFormat shape pane, the new margin moves the list over nicely.Now if you ever need to adjust the space between the text and bullets, a great way is to use Tab markers on the ruler; to display the ruler,click View and check Ruler.Now let's say I want to increasethe space between text and bullets.I'll select the text and onthe ruler, find this upper tab on the bottom of the ruler.I drag the tab and the dotted line shows where the text's left indent will be.To move the bullets, I dragthe tab at the top of the ruler.Now note that if my list hasmore than one text level, I need to select the level of text Iwant to adjust and then move the tabs.My agenda list nowlooks the way I want it to.",weve creat bulletedlist agenda slidenow well make changesto look formattingsinc want appli adiffer theme present ill first let click design choos theme call facet appli differ stylesand format listso place upfrontthi theme use smallfont size textlet increas ill select placehold click home font size choos 24thi font size easier see andmak use space slide font size everi list present chang slide masterwel work slidemast movi 3 chang list format slide masterwev increas font sizelet also increas line spacingto ill select placehold home tab ill click line spacingwher see current set 10 singl space see preview set dont want quit much space 15 let open line space optionsthi includ set forindent well spacingund space listi set singl add spaceincrement boxil chang 10point 20 click okso ive ad bit morespac singl space quit much 15 space weve chang font size line space wantto mention autofit affect thesetyp formattingto demonstr autofitil add 1 item list watch close ityp supportse listadjust start typingit got compressedit continu sowith addit itemthat result autofit adjust line space font size fital list item placeholderwel delet last itembecaus may want autofit whenev happen controlappear call autofit optionslet click undo autofit click stop fit text placeholderth line space return towhat prefer thatso leav autofit undon let say want turn autofit altogeth click control click control autocorrect option autocorrect dialog box uncheckautofit bodi text placehold click okautofit offuntil turn back onnext want move listto right littl bit balanc slide moreto ill increaseit left margin right click text placeholderand click format shapethen click size andproperti text boxin left margin boxil chang set 1 inch 1 inch text move right press arrow boxil close theformat shape pane new margin move list nicelynow ever need adjust space text bullet great way use tab marker ruler display rulerclick view check rulernow let say want increaseth space text bulletsil select text onth ruler find upper tab bottom ruleri drag tab dot line show text left indent beto move bullet dragth tab top rulernow note list hasmor one text level need select level text iwant adjust move tabsmi agenda list nowlook way want
Change list formatting on the slide master,"In this presentation, we want to change the list formatting everywhere, not just on one or two slides.So we'll make all ourchanges on the slide master.To open the slide master,click View, Slide master.To change all bulleted lists, we'll select the slide master thumbnail, the one at the top and change formatting for the listplaceholder and text here.That will affect the bulleted listformatting in each of the master layouts.We'll make changes similarto those we made in movie 2:change font size, linespacing, and indentation.And we'll also change thetype of bullet we're using.Let's start with font size.Because this is the slidemaster, we see the font size,spacing, and bulletfor each level of text.To change the font size forthe top level, I'll select that line, click Home, andlook in the font size boxwhich shows the font size of 18.I'll open the listand change it to 24.Notice that the bullet sizeincreases in proportion to the font size.I also want to increase thefont size for second level text so I'll select it and choose 20.I won't worry about the next threelevels of text because I don't use those.Let's see how the largerfont sizes look on the slides, I click Normal toswitch to normal view.The Agenda slide shows justthe top-level text with the larger font, and the next slide, Our values, shows the second level text as well.Let's look at the other lists.I like the larger fontsizes but I think we shouldincrease the line spacing as well.Let's go back to the slidemaster: I click View slide master and select theslide master thumbnail.Selecting the text placeholder I click Home, Line spacing.The list is currently set at 1.0 or single spacing.To increase line spacing forjust the top-level text, I'll click in that line and clickLine spacing, Line spacing options.Under Spacing, in the Before box I'll increase the spacing from 10points to 20 and click OK.So with this increase, alist of top-level text, like the Agenda list, will changefrom single spacing shown hereto slightly more than singlespacing, which will look like this.line spacing for the other text levels.So in a list like this, thesecond-level text keeps its original spacing but there's a bitmore space above the top level text.I like that.Now on the slide master,let's add more space on the left margin of the list by right clicking the placeholder and clicking Format shape. Then we click Size and properties,Text box, and in the Leftmargin box, increase the numberfrom 0.1 inch to 0.5 inches. As I increase the number, the list moves to the right.So all lists in the presentationwill now have more space on the left.Let's close the format shape pane.Now let's have fun with the typeof bullet we're using for the list.I'll zoom in for a closer look.The theme has agreen arrow for a bullet.I like it but I could choosesomething else if I wanted.To see other options, I'llselect the placeholder andclick the arrow next toBullets on the Home tab.As we point to these alternativebullet styles, we see how they would look.For more choices, clickBullets and numbering.I'd like somethingdifferent so I'll click Picture.This gives me the option tobrowse for a picture file of my own or to searchfor one on the web.The new picture bullet isinserted on the slide master invarious sizes tomatch each text level.I'll zoom back out.We're finished with ourchanges to the slide master, solet's click Normal and lookat the various bulleted listswith the new formatting.Changes to look for include increased lines spacing between top level items, a bigger left margin and thenew picture bullet.As I look through all theslides, I see the changesreflected in every type of list.I like the improvements.Now it's clear how muchthe slide master helps when I want to change bulleted list formatting, for all my lists.",present want chang list format everywher one two slidesso well make ourchang slide masterto open slide masterclick view slide masterto chang bullet list well select slide master thumbnail one top chang format listplacehold text herethat affect bullet listformat master layoutswel make chang similarto made movi 2chang font size linespac indentationand well also chang thetyp bullet usinglet start font sizebecaus slidemast see font sizespac bulletfor level textto chang font size forth top level ill select line click home andlook font size boxwhich show font size 18ill open listand chang 24notic bullet sizeincreas proport font sizei also want increas thefont size second level text ill select choos 20i wont worri next threelevel text dont use thoselet see largerfont size look slide click normal toswitch normal viewth agenda slide show justth toplevel text larger font next slide valu show second level text welllet look listsi like larger fontsiz think shouldincreas line space welllet go back slidemast click view slide master select theslid master thumbnailselect text placehold click home line spacingth list current set 10 singl spacingto increas line space forjust toplevel text ill click line clicklin space line space optionsund space box ill increas space 10point 20 click okso increas alist toplevel text like agenda list changefrom singl space shown hereto slightli singlespac look like thislin space text levelsso list like thesecondlevel text keep origin space there bitmor space top level texti like thatnow slide masterlet add space left margin list right click placehold click format shape click size propertiestext box leftmargin box increas numberfrom 01 inch 05 inch increas number list move rightso list presentationwil space leftlet close format shape panenow let fun typeof bullet use listil zoom closer lookth theme agreen arrow bulleti like could choosesometh els wantedto see option illselect placehold andclick arrow next tobullet home taba point alternativebullet style see would lookfor choic clickbullet numberingid like somethingdiffer ill click picturethi give option tobrows pictur file searchfor one webth new pictur bullet isinsert slide master invari size tomatch text levelil zoom back outwer finish ourchang slide master solet click normal lookat variou bullet listswith new formattingchang look includ increas line space top level item bigger left margin thenew pictur bulleta look theslid see changesreflect everi type listi like improvementsnow clear muchth slide master help want chang bullet list format list

Add headers and footers to slides,"In our ContosoPharmaceuticals presentation, we are ready to add headers and footers.We want slide numberseverywhere but on the title slideand we want the dateonly on the title slide.How do we do that? To review our options, let’s click Insert, Header and footer.In the Header and footer dialogbox, the slide tab is selected.Don't show on title slide.This allows me to make anexception for the title slide,so I'll check everything Iwant for all the other slides,slide number and footer whereI'll type the company's web address.I click Don't show on title slide, and then Apply to all to applythese choices everywhere else.The title slide is unaffected and the slide number andfooter appear on the other slides.Let's zoom in for a better view.I don't really like thegreen color for the footer, it's ard to see, but that's a formatting issue and we'll deal with that in movie 3. I'll zoom back out.To apply what we want on the title slide, we'll select that slide andclick Header and footer.Now the effect of the optionDon't show on title slide isto clear all thecheckboxes for the title slide.A way around that is tochoose what I want for the title slide and click Apply whichaffects only the selected slide.So I'll check Date andtime, leave it set to Update automatically, and select a date format.The formats include just thedate, the date and time, or just the time, I'll choose a simple date.I'd also like to includethe text footer, the web address, on the titleslide, so I'll check Footer.Last, we'll uncheck Don't showon title slide and click Apply.The date and the textfooter appear but not the slide number, that's what we want. determined by the layout for this title slide.The other slides are unaffectedby my choices for the title slide.We now have two setsof options applied.When I select the titleslide and click Header and footerto open the dialog box, Isee the selections I made for this slide: the date and footer.As long as I click Applyrather than Apply to all, the settings here affectonly the title slide.When I select slide 2 andclick Header and footer, I see the selections I appliedto all the other slides: the slide number and footer.If I make a change here such as unchecking the footer box and click Apply to all, the footer disappears from the slides.And the change also appliesto the title slide which nowshows the slidenumber and nothing else.I'll need to reopen the Header and footer dialog box for the title slide, reselect towhat I want for that slide,and click Apply.",contosopharmaceut present readi add header footersw want slide numberseverywher titl slideand want dateonli titl slidehow review option let click insert header footerin header footer dialogbox slide tab selecteddont show titl slidethi allow make anexcept titl slideso ill check everyth iwant slidesslid number footer whereil type compani web addressi click dont show titl slide appli applythes choic everywher elseth titl slide unaffect slide number andfoot appear slideslet zoom better viewi dont realli like thegreen color footer ard see that format issu well deal movi 3 ill zoom back outto appli want titl slide well select slide andclick header footernow effect optiondont show titl slide isto clear thecheckbox titl slidea way around tochoos want titl slide click appli whichaffect select slideso ill check date andtim leav set updat automat select date formatth format includ thedat date time time ill choos simpl dateid also like includeth text footer web address titleslid ill check footerlast well uncheck dont showon titl slide click applyth date textfoot appear slide number that want determin layout titl slideth slide unaffectedbi choic titl slidew two setsof option appliedwhen select titleslid click header footerto open dialog box ise select made slide date footera long click applyrath appli set affectonli titl slidewhen select slide 2 andclick header footer see select appliedto slide slide number footerif make chang uncheck footer box click appli footer disappear slidesand chang also appliesto titl slide nowshow slidenumb noth elseil need reopen header footer dialog box titl slide reselect towhat want slideand click appli
Edit headers and footers on the slide master,"I've applied headers andfooters to this presentation andthere are a couple ofthings I want to change.I'll zoom in for a closer look.On the title slide, the dateappears, but it's broken into two lines.I want to sit on one line.My other concern is with the textfooter for the rest of the slides.The light green fontcolor is hard to see.I'll zoom back out.For formatting issues likethese, related to the look,size or position of headers andfooters, edit the slide master.To open the slide masterclick View slide master;the slide master isthe top slide thumbnail.You make changes to it thatyou want to apply to all slides.You can also make changesto specific layouts, any of these slides below the slide master.One of our formatting issues iswith the date on the title slide.I've selected thetitle slide master layout.I'll zoom in a little.With the date format I chose,the placeholder is too small.This is what the datelooks like on the title slide.See how it runs on to a second line.You can't see that in slidemaster view on this layout,we just see the defaultdate format which does fit.In any case we need toenlarge the date placeholder.I'll select it, point to acorner sizing handle, click the two headed arrow cursor anddrag down to lengthen the placeholder.The longer date formatshould now fit on one line.We'll check that in a minute.To change the color for the textfooter, I'll click the slide master.This change needs to applyto all the relevant layouts.The footers that appear onthe slide master are the text footer and date; the date shows on the slide master even though I've chosen notto show it on the slides.First, let's press Ctrl and clickto select both footer placeholders.Then we'll click Home, Font color and change the font color to dark blue and let's click Bold to turn off the bold formatting.Also let's center the footer placeholder; to do so select it, under Drawing tools click format and click Align objects. Make sure Align to slide is selected and click Align center.To center the text inside the placeholder, I'll leave the box selected, click Home and click Center.Let's click Normal to see theeffect of these changes on the slides.The text footer is nowcentered and is blue instead of green.On the title slide,the date fits on one linebut the text footer, the webaddress looks like it's slid down.This is because I centeredthe text within the footerplaceholder on the slide master.That centered the texteverywhere including on the title slide.When I select theplaceholder, think of it in a horizontal orientation and youcan see the text is centered.Let's go back to the slide master, View, Slide master to fix the title slide.The title slide masterlayout is selected, this layout gives me a way to correct the problem, I'll select the footer placeholder on the layout and I'll click Home, Align left to movethe footer text back up.Think of Align left as ifthis box were horizontal.This change willapply only to this layout.I'll click Normal toswitch back to that view;the text footer is correctlyplaced now on the title slide.By using the various options in the Header and footer dialog box and going to the slide master to make formatting and layout changes, I've got the headers andfooters exactly as I want them.",ive appli header andfoot present andther coupl ofth want changeil zoom closer lookon titl slide dateappear broken two linesi want sit one linemi concern textfoot rest slidesth light green fontcolor hard seeill zoom back outfor format issu likethes relat looksiz posit header andfoot edit slide masterto open slide masterclick view slide masterth slide master isth top slide thumbnaily make chang thatyou want appli slidesy also make changesto specif layout slide slide masteron format issu iswith date titl slideiv select thetitl slide master layoutil zoom littlewith date format choseth placehold smallthi datelook like titl slidese run second liney cant see slidemast view layoutw see defaultd format fitin case need toenlarg date placeholderil select point acorn size handl click two head arrow cursor anddrag lengthen placeholderth longer date formatshould fit one linewel check minuteto chang color textfoot ill click slide masterthi chang need applyto relev layoutsth footer appear onth slide master text footer date date show slide master even though ive chosen notto show slidesfirst let press ctrl clickto select footer placeholdersthen well click home font color chang font color dark blue let click bold turn bold formattingalso let center footer placehold select draw tool click format click align object make sure align slide select click align centerto center text insid placehold ill leav box select click home click centerlet click normal see theeffect chang slidesth text footer nowcent blue instead greenon titl slideth date fit one linebut text footer webaddress look like slid downthi centeredth text within footerplacehold slide masterthat center texteverywher includ titl slidewhen select theplacehold think horizont orient youcan see text centeredlet go back slide master view slide master fix titl slideth titl slide masterlayout select layout give way correct problem ill select footer placehold layout ill click home align left moveth footer text back upthink align left ifthi box horizontalthi chang willappli layoutil click normal toswitch back viewth text footer correctlyplac titl slidebi use variou option header footer dialog box go slide master make format layout chang ive got header andfoot exactli want
Add sound effects to an animation,"Imagine you have theperfect sound effects for an animation but you're unsure how to add them.For instance here's ananimation, a flying witch.I want to add a witch'slaugh to the animation and to play an eerie tune.How would I add thesesounds to the flying witch?Let's step through it.I've clicked the Animationstab so we can work with the animation effect. Now I'll zoom out in order to show the margins around the slide.The animation effect is this motion path, it's applied to the witch graphic. I'll click Preview to play the effect again, the witch enters the slide frame from the bottom right corner and exits out the top left corner.To add the witch's laugh,we'll click Animation pane and add the sound to themotion path effect.In the pane this item represents the motion path effect that's applied.This little icon indicatesthat it's a Straight line motion path and it's appliedto picture 2, the witch graphic.To work with options for the motion path, we select it in the pane, click this arrow todisplay its menu and click Effect options.To make a sound play with the motion path, we click the arrow next to the sound box.Currently no sound is applied.I can apply one of thebuilt in sounds or choose Other sound to select a file of my own.This sound file Cackle.wav is the witch's laugh.I'll select it and click OK.The sound immediately plays a little preview and I see that the sound file is nowselected in the sound box, I'll click OK.Let's click Playall to see a preview.The flying witch now has a laugh, the laughing sound is part of the motion path effect and plays when the motion path plays.I can apply only one sounddirectly to the motion path.To add the second sound, the background music, we'll use another method.We click Insert, then Audio and Audio on my PC. Here's the sound file I want, Eerie music.wav. I'll select it and click Insert.When I insert a sound file by itself, it's treated as an animation effect and the effect appears in the animation pane.The file itself gets inserted with a play bar in the middle of the slide, I'll move it down so we can see it better.If we look closely at theeffect over in the pane, we see this mouse icon which meansthe music is set to play when I click the play bar. I'll click Play all for a preview.The witch and her laughplay immediately, but I have to click Play to startthe background music.Instead I want it to start by itselfand play along with the other effects.To change how the musicstarts I select the sound iconand under Audio toolsclick Playback, next to StartI'll click the arrow andchange On click to Automatically.Now in the animation panethe sound effect has a clock icon which means it will start on its own but after the preceding effect. We'll click its arrow and change the Start after previous setting to Start with previous.All effects will now play together.Let's close the animation pane.The final thing we'll dois select the sound icon anddrag it off the slide since we don'tneed to click it to start the music.Let's have a look at theanimation in slideshow view.With the new sounds, ourhaunted scene is complete.",imagin theperfect sound effect anim your unsur add themfor instanc here ananim fli witchi want add witchslaugh anim play eeri tunehow would add thesesound fli witchlet step itiv click animationstab work anim effect ill zoom order show margin around slideth anim effect motion path appli witch graphic ill click preview play effect witch enter slide frame bottom right corner exit top left cornerto add witch laughwel click anim pane add sound themot path effectin pane item repres motion path effect that appliedthi littl icon indicatesthat straight line motion path appliedto pictur 2 witch graphicto work option motion path select pane click arrow todisplay menu click effect optionsto make sound play motion path click arrow next sound boxcurr sound appliedi appli one thebuilt sound choos sound select file ownthi sound file cacklewav witch laughil select click okth sound immedi play littl preview see sound file nowselect sound box ill click oklet click playal see previewth fli witch laugh laugh sound part motion path effect play motion path playsi appli one sounddirectli motion pathto add second sound background music well use anoth methodw click insert audio audio pc here sound file want eeri musicwav ill select click insertwhen insert sound file treat anim effect effect appear anim paneth file get insert play bar middl slide ill move see betterif look close theeffect pane see mous icon meansth music set play click play bar ill click play previewth witch laughplay immedi click play startth background musicinstead want start itselfand play along effectsto chang musicstart select sound iconand audio toolsclick playback next startil click arrow andchang click automaticallynow anim paneth sound effect clock icon mean start preced effect well click arrow chang start previou set start previousal effect play togetherlet close anim paneth final thing well doi select sound icon anddrag slide sinc dontne click start musiclet look theanim slideshow viewwith new sound ourhaunt scene complet
"Animate pictures, shapes, text, and other objects","You can animate just about anythingin PowerPoint 2013 and it's easy to do.What is a PowerPoint animation?I'll show you. This slide contains four objects, text, a picture, a chart and a shapeand each one has a differenttype of animation assigned to it.Press Shift-F5 to play theslide show from the current slide.I built the slide so that each timeI click a different animation plays.First the text, thisanimation is called Fly in and I have it set so that each time Iclick a line of text flies in.The picture has the Fadeanimation attached to it.The chart uses the Wipeanimation, each time I click some bars wipe on which makes it appear as though the bars are growing or drawing on and on the shape I applied the Fill color animation which changes theFill colors slowly from blue to orange.So as you can see, aPowerPoint animation is nothing morethan something changing on a slide.It can be motion, a fade, a wipe, colors or a combination.Now let's take a closerlook at those animations.Here's the same slidewith the animations removed.To add an animation, youfirst select what you want to animate, choose an animation andthen modify it with effect options.Click the text, then go to the Animations tab, open the Animations gallery and select one.You can keep tryinganimations until you find one you like.Notice that every time youselect one, you see a preview.That's the defaultworkflow for creating animations.You make a change then see apreview, make another change, see a preview. You can click here and turn off Auto preview if you want.Then you can click this buttonto Preview animations manually.If you don't find exactly what you're looking for, choose an animation that's closeand then check out the Effect options available for the animation.In the case of Fly in, youcan choose a direction and then choose the sequence thatyou want to bring in the text.As one object or All atonce brings the entire block of text in at once or you canbring the text in by paragraph.Again you can animateanything in three steps.Select the picture, selectan animation, this time let's choose Shape and tweak it with an effect option.For shape you can choose a shapeand direction.Select the chart, choose an animationand choose an effect option.Let's bring the chartelements in by series.Select the shape, choose an animationthen choose an effect option.In this case wechoose a color to fade to.One more thing, if you everwant to remove an animation,just select the object thathas the animation applied to it and then click None.With animations you can getas complex as you want or you can keep it simple.",anim anythingin powerpoint 2013 easi dowhat powerpoint animationil show slide contain four object text pictur chart shapeand one differenttyp anim assign itpress shiftf5 play theslid show current slidei built slide timei click differ anim playsfirst text thisanim call fli set time iclick line text fli inth pictur fadeanim attach itth chart use wipeanim time click bar wipe make appear though bar grow draw shape appli fill color anim chang thefil color slowli blue orangeso see apowerpoint anim noth morethan someth chang slideit motion fade wipe color combinationnow let take closerlook animationsher slidewith anim removedto add anim youfirst select want anim choos anim andthen modifi effect optionsclick text go anim tab open anim galleri select oney keep tryinganim find one likenotic everi time youselect one see previewthat defaultworkflow creat animationsy make chang see apreview make anoth chang see preview click turn auto preview wantthen click buttonto preview anim manuallyif dont find exactli your look choos anim that closeand check effect option avail animationin case fli youcan choos direct choos sequenc thatyou want bring texta one object atonc bring entir block text canbr text paragraphagain animateanyth three stepsselect pictur selectan anim time let choos shape tweak effect optionfor shape choos shapeand directionselect chart choos animationand choos effect optionlet bring chartel seriesselect shape choos animationthen choos effect optionin case wechoos color fade toon thing everw remov animationjust select object thatha anim appli click nonewith anim geta complex want keep simpl
Animate text,"Many presenters these daysare using less text and more things like videos and charts to make their slides more visually appealing, but there's no reason why text can't be used effectively especially with the help of animation.You already saw how to addbasic motion animations to text, but let's say we want ourtext to really have a visual impact.Before we even addanimation to this slide, we can addimpact by rewriting thetext to use fewer words and choosing words that are more direct.Then we can choose fontstyles and sizes to turn the wallof words into organized information that's easier to understand and remember. Now we can add animation to the title to give it more impact.Select the title, then go to theAnimations tab and open the gallery.Animations are dividedinto four categories; Entrance animations bring an objectinto view on the slide, Exit animations take an objectout of view on the slide and Emphasis animations add something toan object that's already on the slide.Motion paths let you create custom animations by moving objects around on a slide. Let's try Zoom;this works but it might be more effective if the words came in one after the other.In Effect options for Zoom, we can choose a vanishing point, but as far as the Sequence, there is no choice forbringing the words in individually.To get more options,click the Dialog box launcher.Now we have threetabs worth of options.Let's look around.In Animate text thereis a By word option.Let's try that. Interesting.It looks like each word iszooming in from its own vanishing point.Let's look at that option again.Here it says % delay between words.Let's see what happenswhen we make that 100%.Perfect.In general, the best way to learnabout animations is to experiment.Start with a rough idea andthen check out the optionsuntil you find what you want.You may also find something better.Now let's dosomething with this text.I want all of it to be onthe slide the whole time butadd some kind of emphasisas I talk about each line, so we don't want to bring the text inor take it out, but add an emphasis.What does Wave look like?Interesting. I'll have to remember that one for another slide but not for this one.What about Brush color?Looks like it's brushing colorover the text one letter at a time.I think this will workexcept for a few things.First, I want to gofrom a dark color to light.We don't see any change nowbecause it's brushing white over white, so select the text and in the mini toolbarselect a fairly dark blue.Now the text is dark until wehighlight it with the animation.The last thing we need to do is bringthe text in one paragraph at a time.That should work. Press Shift-F5, click and the title zooms in.Then as we talk about the specificswe click to add emphasis to each line.Animation can do a lot toadd meaning to your text.For example, we're addingwhite color to the text as we move through theanimation sequence, which makes it appear as if we'rebuilding on the information.Click the Dialog box launcher, click After Animation and select dark blue. Now it appears as if we're moving from row to row without each line building on the previous one. It's a subtle change but it does have an impact on how we present our information.The bottom line - effective text animation reinforces the meaning of the text.",mani present daysar use less text thing like video chart make slide visual appeal there reason text cant use effect especi help animationy alreadi saw addbas motion anim text let say want ourtext realli visual impactbefor even addanim slide addimpact rewrit thetext use fewer word choos word directthen choos fontstyl size turn wallof word organ inform that easier understand rememb add anim titl give impactselect titl go theanim tab open galleryanim dividedinto four categori entranc anim bring objectinto view slide exit anim take objectout view slide emphasi anim add someth toan object that alreadi slidemot path let creat custom anim move object around slide let tri zoomthi work might effect word came one otherin effect option zoom choos vanish point far sequenc choic forbring word individuallyto get optionsclick dialog box launchernow threetab worth optionslet look aroundin anim text therei word optionlet tri interestingit look like word iszoom vanish pointlet look option againher say delay wordslet see happenswhen make 100perfectin gener best way learnabout anim experimentstart rough idea andthen check optionsuntil find wantyou may also find someth betternow let dosometh texti want onth slide whole time butadd kind emphasisa talk line dont want bring text inor take add emphasiswhat wave look likeinterest ill rememb one anoth slide onewhat brush colorlook like brush colorov text one letter timei think workexcept thingsfirst want gofrom dark color lightw dont see chang nowbecaus brush white white select text mini toolbarselect fairli dark bluenow text dark wehighlight animationth last thing need bringth text one paragraph timethat work press shiftf5 click titl zoom inthen talk specificsw click add emphasi lineanim lot toadd mean textfor exampl addingwhit color text move theanim sequenc make appear werebuild informationclick dialog box launcher click anim select dark blue appear move row row without line build previou one subtl chang impact present informationth bottom line effect text anim reinforc mean text
Animate pictures and shapes,"The process of animatingany object is the same, select what you want to animate, add ananimation then choose Effect options.Let's think about whatwe can do with this slide.The point of the slide isto introduce each person.So let's do that by using anentrance animation to bring in each picture.Select the first picture, go to the Animations tab, and open the gallery. We could do a motion animation like Fly in but let's try a simple Fade animation instead.That's nice, becauseit supports the design.Let's also do something withthe shapes behind each picture.For these we need to use anEmphasis animation becausethe shapes willalready be on the slide.There is Wave again.It's interesting, but we needsomething a bit more subtle, like Fill color.In Effect optionschanges the color to orange.That will work. Next we need to copy these animations and options to the other pictures and shapes.Here's an easy way to do that.Select the first picture thendouble click the Animation painter.Now all you have to do isclick the other pictures and the animation andsettings are copied.Click Animationpainter again to turn it off.Now we'll do the same for the shapes.All the animations are inplace but we're not done yet.Click Preview. The animations play correctly but not in the right order.To fix that, open the Animation pane.This is an essential toolfor working with animations.It lists all the animationsin the order they occur and the names of the objectsthat are being animated.It's also a timeline thatshows how long each animation runs and it shows how eachanimation is triggered or starts.Notice that the names of theobjects are not necessarilyrelated to where theyappear on the slide.Click an object to see whichanimation is associated with it.For example the firstpicture is the first animation.First let's put theanimations in the right order.To do that click an animationand drag it to a new position.We want the first pictureto animate with the first shape, the second picturewith the second shape, and the third picture with the third shape.Click here to preview the animation.Looks like everything isrunning in the right order.But next we need to changewhen the animations play.Currently each animation isset to start with a mouse click.That means we need to clickonce to run a picture, thenagain to run the shape, then againto run the next picture and so on.What we want is for eachpicture to start with a clickand for the shapes behind eachpicture to start at the same time.So here's how we fix that.Right click the first shapeand select Start with previous.Now the shape animation will startwhen the picture animation starts.Let's also do that withthe two remaining shapes.Press Shift-F5 torun the current slide.When we, the picture fades inand the shape changes colors.And that goes for thesecond and third picture in shape too, almost perfect.But let's do one more thing.These bars in the timelinedisplay the duration of each animation.Click the right border ofeach shape and drag it to the left to shorten theUse the screen tip to setan end time of 1 second.Of course you can do a lotmore with shapes and picturesand clip art and all the otherobjects but now you have a good start.",process animatingani object select want anim add ananim choos effect optionslet think whatw slideth point slide isto introduc personso let use anentr anim bring pictureselect first pictur go anim tab open galleri could motion anim like fli let tri simpl fade anim insteadthat nice becauseit support designlet also someth withth shape behind picturefor need use anemphasi anim becauseth shape willalreadi slidether wave againit interest needsometh bit subtl like fill colorin effect optionschang color orangethat work next need copi anim option pictur shapesher easi way thatselect first pictur thendoubl click anim painternow isclick pictur anim andset copiedclick animationpaint turn offnow well shapesal anim inplac done yetclick preview anim play correctli right orderto fix open anim panethi essenti toolfor work animationsit list animationsin order occur name objectsthat animatedit also timelin thatshow long anim run show eachanim trigger startsnotic name theobject necessarilyrel theyappear slideclick object see whichanim associ itfor exampl firstpictur first animationfirst let put theanim right orderto click animationand drag new positionw want first pictureto anim first shape second picturewith second shape third pictur third shapeclick preview animationlook like everyth isrun right orderbut next need changewhen anim playcurr anim isset start mous clickthat mean need clickonc run pictur thenagain run shape againto run next pictur onwhat want eachpictur start clickand shape behind eachpictur start timeso here fix thatright click first shapeand select start previousnow shape anim startwhen pictur anim startslet also withth two remain shapespress shiftf5 torun current slidewhen pictur fade inand shape chang colorsand goe thesecond third pictur shape almost perfectbut let one thingthes bar timelinedisplay durat animationclick right border ofeach shape drag left shorten theus screen tip setan end time 1 secondof cours lotmor shape picturesand clip art otherobject good start
Animate charts and SmartArt,"Charts and SmartArt aresimilar to text in that you can animate elements individually. For charts, the trick is to find an animation that makes sense with the chart style.In this column chart,animations like Fly inor Bounce don't do much tohelp an audience visualize the data but let's try a Wipe.By default everything wipes on at once.Go to Effect options.As you can see, we have lots of choices, let's stick with the upper direction so it appears the columns grow as they animate on.Down here we can choose tohave all the elements in each series or category animate on at once or each element in a series or category animate on.Let's try it by series.So when we talk about thedifferences between the years,we can bring the threeseries in one at a time.The only thing wrong is thatthe grid animates on too andwhat we want is forthe grid to be static.These numbers correspond to the fouranimations associated with the chart.Select the first animation which isthe one for the grid and press Delete.Now when we preview theanimation, the grid is static.You can animate a pie chartusing the same logic exceptyou'll use a Wheel animationwhich wipes on the chart like a clock.What kind of animation do youthink would work with a scatter chart?SmartArt animation works about the same.You choose an animation thatmakes sense for how you wantto bring in or emphasizethe elements of the graphic.We could use a Fade or aWipe animation for this organization chart but something like a Zoom would work too.Then choose the sequence inwhich you want to bring the elements in, for example Level at once brings all the elements in each level on one at a time.Here's an interesting graphic, inthis one it would make senseto animate the gravity arrow flying down and the lift arrow flying up and the text fading in.Here's how we do that.First, select the Fly in animation then in Effect options choose One by one.Next open the animation pane, select Animation 1 which brings in the bar and delete it.Click Play from, so now we know the firstanimation brings in the gravity arrow, select the first animation and in Effect options select From top.Select the second animation which brings in the gravity text and choose Fade then do the same for ""Lift"".Now when we preview,everything plays the way we want it to.So far we have pretty muchstayed with the default andbuilt-in animations and options.",chart smartart aresimilar text anim element individu chart trick find anim make sens chart stylein column chartanim like fli inor bounc dont much tohelp audienc visual data let tri wipebi default everyth wipe oncego effect optionsa see lot choic let stick upper direct appear column grow anim ondown choos tohav element seri categori anim element seri categori anim onlet tri seriesso talk thediffer yearsw bring threeseri one timeth thing wrong thatth grid anim andwhat want forth grid staticthes number correspond fouranim associ chartselect first anim isth one grid press deletenow preview theanim grid staticy anim pie chartus logic exceptyoul use wheel animationwhich wipe chart like clockwhat kind anim youthink would work scatter chartsmartart anim work samey choos anim thatmak sens wantto bring emphasizeth element graphicw could use fade awip anim organ chart someth like zoom would work toothen choos sequenc inwhich want bring element exampl level bring element level one timeher interest graphic inthi one would make senseto anim graviti arrow fli lift arrow fli text fade inher thatfirst select fli anim effect option choos one onenext open anim pane select anim 1 bring bar delet itclick play know firstanim bring graviti arrow select first anim effect option select topselect second anim bring graviti text choos fade liftnow previeweveryth play way want toso far pretti muchstay default andbuiltin anim option
Create custom animations with motion paths,"If you're the adventuroustype, you can create somepretty amazing presentationswith lots of motion path animations.You'll see that it's not all thatdifficult once you get the hang of it.But let's start out small.Click the shapecalled ""Behind shape 1"".Now if we add an entranceanimation like Fly in, we can control where the shape ends up, and the direction and sequence with Effect options. But we can't control where the shape begins or the path it takes.To do that, we needto use motion paths.Go down to Motionpaths and select Lines.This is the motion path,the line describes the path.The green arrow indicateswhere the shape starts and the red arrow indicateswhere the shape ends.Select the path, this half transparent shape shows the shape at its endpoint.Drag the red arrow and position theendpoint over the ""In front shape"".Then preview the animation and thefirst shape moves behind the second one.Motion paths can be a lotof fun, try some other ones like Arcs, and Loopsalso click Custom path if you want to draw your own motion path.Let's go back to the previous slide and add a motion path to ""Behind shape 2"". Use the Animation painter to copy the animationthen select the motion path and move its in point on top of the ""In front shape"". Preview the animation.The animation works all right but the  second ""Behind shape""ends up covering up theshape we want to keep on top.This is a problem you'll run into more often when you're creating custom animations, but it's easy to fix.Right click the shape andclick Send to back, Send backward.Now preview the animation.That's the way we want it. You see, all the objects on the slide are organized into layers; by sending the shapes backward we moved it to a layerbehind the ""In front shape"".Here's another thing youcan do to create custom animations: this ball shape actually contains two animations: a motion path that moves the shape horizontally and a spin animation that makes the ball appear to roll as it moves.To add multiple animations to an object select the firstanimation in this gallery then click Add animationto add the others.Also don't forget about thoseadditional effect and timing options.Here's another way to open thatdialog box in the animation pane.Click the arrow next to theanimation and click Effect options.I added Auto reverse to the animations so the objects return to their original positions.So now you have everything you need to get started with animations in PowerPoint.The best way to understand animations is to experiment on your own.",your adventuroustyp creat somepretti amaz presentationswith lot motion path animationsyoul see thatdifficult get hang itbut let start smallclick shapecal behind shape 1now add entranceanim like fli control shape end direct sequenc effect option cant control shape begin path takesto needto use motion pathsgo motionpath select linesthi motion pathth line describ pathth green arrow indicateswher shape start red arrow indicateswher shape endsselect path half transpar shape show shape endpointdrag red arrow posit theendpoint front shapethen preview anim thefirst shape move behind second onemot path lotof fun tri one like arc loopsalso click custom path want draw motion pathlet go back previou slide add motion path behind shape 2 use anim painter copi animationthen select motion path move point top front shape preview animationth anim work right second behind shapeend cover theshap want keep topthi problem youll run often your creat custom anim easi fixright click shape andclick send back send backwardnow preview animationthat way want see object slide organ layer send shape backward move layerbehind front shapeher anoth thing youcan creat custom anim ball shape actual contain two anim motion path move shape horizont spin anim make ball appear roll movesto add multipl anim object select firstanim galleri click add animationto add othersalso dont forget thoseaddit effect time optionsher anoth way open thatdialog box anim paneclick arrow next theanim click effect optionsi ad auto revers anim object return origin positionsso everyth need get start anim powerpointth best way understand anim experi
Trigger an animation effect,"When you want to clicksomething specific on the slide,like each arrow shape here to startan animation effect, use a trigger.On this slide, each green arrowtriggers a text effect when I click it.Here's the sequence again.Arrow 1 triggers the first textanimation which has a Wipe entrance effect.Arrow 2 triggers the secondeffect and Arrow 3 triggers the third.Compare this with a typicallist animation where I clickto play each effect but I don'tclick anything specific to do it.In the first example, theeffect starts only when I click an arrow which is thetrigger for the effect, so triggers let me specify click points for effects.I can create as manytriggers as I need.For example, I could makethis text banner be a trigger also, starting a picture effect.To set up a trigger, youfirst apply an animation effectto the thing you want to trigger.For this slide, I want totrigger a text effect on this banner shape; I'll select the shape and apply a Wipe entrance effect.Now I specify atrigger for the effect.In the animation pane, I select the effect which activates the trigger command. I click Trigger, point to On click of and select Arrow 1 which is my arrow shape over here. Now the arrow is a trigger.Triggers are useful forstarting sound files and videos,which PowerPoint viewsas animation effects.Instead of clicking thesound media on this slide to play it, I can pull it off theslide so it never appears and set up a trigger to playit, namely this button shape.On the slide, when I click thebutton, it triggers the sound effect.On a slide with a video,I can do the same thing.Pull the video media offthe slide, set it to play full screen and create a trigger tostart it, this big green arrow.On the slide, when Iclick the big green arrow, it triggers the video to play.",want clicksometh specif slidelik arrow shape startan anim effect use triggeron slide green arrowtrigg text effect click ither sequenc againarrow 1 trigger first textanim wipe entranc effectarrow 2 trigger secondeffect arrow 3 trigger thirdcompar typicallist anim clickto play effect dontclick anyth specif itin first exampl theeffect start click arrow thetrigg effect trigger let specifi click point effectsi creat manytrigg needfor exampl could makethi text banner trigger also start pictur effectto set trigger youfirst appli anim effectto thing want triggerfor slide want totrigg text effect banner shape ill select shape appli wipe entranc effectnow specifi atrigg effectin anim pane select effect activ trigger command click trigger point click select arrow 1 arrow shape arrow triggertrigg use forstart sound file videoswhich powerpoint viewsa anim effectsinstead click thesound media slide play pull theslid never appear set trigger playit name button shapeon slide click thebutton trigger sound effecton slide videoi thingpul video media offth slide set play full screen creat trigger tostart big green arrowon slide iclick big green arrow trigger video play
"Trigger multiple effects, including sound","The purpose of a trigger isto start an effect, either an animation effect or a video or sound effect.So before you can create atrigger, you need to first add an effect.Here's the process in detail.On this slide, I wantthe circle that says ""Test yourself"" to trigger theentrance of a test question.This is how I want the slide to play; the ""Test yourself"" button triggers the test question to fly in and notice that the button alsotriggers a sound, a bell dings when the test question appears.So the button triggers two effects,the test questions entrance and a sound.To create this triggeredsequence, first I'll apply the animation effect to theplaceholder with the test question,  I'll select it and in theAnimation gallery I'll choose Fly in.I want it to come in fromthe bottom and checking Effect options, I see thatit's set to From bottom.Now I'm ready to set up the triggerthat will display the test question.I'll open the animationpane to work with my effects.Here's the Fly in effect -I want the ""Test yourself"" button to be the trigger,so I make sure the Fly in effect is selected and I click Trigger, point to On click of and select the trigger I wantwhich is the ""Test yourself"" button.This is how a trigger effectlooks in the animation pane.It has a heading over itthat says trigger and the name of the trigger, so the Fly in effect for my test questionis triggered by the""Test yourself"" button.On the slide, you'll seea lightning bolt next to a triggered item, which in this case is the test question.I'll move the test questionover the button so it appears in the center of the slideand I'll preview the sequence in slide show view.I click my trigger andthe test question appears.Next I want to add a sound effectthat plays with the test question.To insert the soundeffect, I'll click Insert, Audio,Audio on my PC andselect my sound file.The sound file gets insertedin the middle of the slide,I'll drag it up tomake it more visible.Now notice how the soundfile appears in the animation pane, it's automaticallyset up as its own trigger.This means that to playthe sound I have to click the sound icon itself, however, I don't want the icon to show on the slide which means I need to set up something else to trigger the sound. Also I want the sound to play when I click the ""Test yourself"" button so I'll make the ""Test yourself"" button be the trigger for the sound effect.The simplest way to do thisis to select the sound effectin the pane and drag it upunder the button trigger.Now the button will triggerboth the test question and the sound, but note both effects have a mouse click iconwhich means I'd have toclick the ""Test yourself"" buttona second time to play the sound.I want the effects toplay together, so I'll simplychange the sound effectto Start with previous.Last I'll select the soundicon and drag it off the slideas I won't need to clickit to trigger the sound.And now let's trythe trigger -perfect.",purpos trigger isto start effect either anim effect video sound effectso creat atrigg need first add effecther process detailon slide wantth circl say test trigger theentranc test questionthi want slide play test button trigger test question fli notic button alsotrigg sound bell ding test question appearsso button trigger two effectsth test question entranc soundto creat triggeredsequ first ill appli anim effect theplacehold test question ill select theanim galleri ill choos fli ini want come fromth bottom check effect option see thatit set bottomnow im readi set triggerthat display test questionil open animationpan work effectsher fli effect want test button triggerso make sure fli effect select click trigger point click select trigger wantwhich test buttonthi trigger effectlook anim paneit head itthat say trigger name trigger fli effect test questioni trigger thetest buttonon slide youll seea lightn bolt next trigger item case test questionil move test questionov button appear center slideand ill preview sequenc slide show viewi click trigger andth test question appearsnext want add sound effectthat play test questionto insert soundeffect ill click insert audioaudio pc andselect sound fileth sound file get insertedin middl slideil drag tomak visiblenow notic soundfil appear anim pane automaticallyset triggerthi mean playth sound click sound icon howev dont want icon show slide mean need set someth els trigger sound also want sound play click test button ill make test button trigger sound effectth simplest way thisi select sound effectin pane drag upund button triggernow button triggerboth test question sound note effect mous click iconwhich mean id toclick test buttona second time play soundi want effect toplay togeth ill simplychang sound effectto start previouslast ill select soundicon drag slidea wont need clickit trigger soundand let tryth trigger perfect
Trigger a video,"A trigger gives you anadvantage when you want to play a video, it enables you to start the video without having to click it to do so. You can pull the video off the slide so it doesn't show before you play it, then using the Playback tab you can set it to play full screen and set up a trigger like thispyramid shape to start it.In a Slideshow, you'ddisplay the slide, click the trigger and the video wouldstart and play full screen.Let's take this step by step, here's the slide at an earlier stage.I've created this shapeand now I'll insert my videousing the Insert tab,Video, Video on my PC.The inserted video coversthe shape but that doesn'tmatter because I'm going todrag it off the slide, I can make it as small as I want.Now I'll use Video toolsand the Playback tab and I'll select the option to play it full screen, however there's a critical issue. I need a way to start the video, I'm going to open the Animation pane now because it helps explain what's going on.I'll zoom out a little more,PowerPoint treats videoand sound as effects, so this effect represents the video itself and like other effects, it appearsin the Animation pane.Also it's shown as already having atrigger, the movie is its own trigger.In other words, it'sautomatically set up so that I haveto click the movie itself to play it but since I don't want the video to appear before it plays and I've pulled it off the slide, I need a way to start it.Here's one option, on thePlayback tab, I can change this from On click to Automatically.Now look at the effects inthe animation pane, this play effect will start the videoautomatically and it will play full screen.Let's see it in a preview, the video plays full screen but starts up instantly and bypasses the view of the slide.In this case I do want todisplay the slide, so this shape and message will appear. So I need to trigger the video from the slide,given that I'll remove this automatic play effect and set up the shape as a trigger.I make sure the video effectis selected in the Animation pane, then I click Trigger, On click ofPyramid which is the shape.Now the pyramid shape isthe trigger for the video and that's what I needto click to start it.Let's try it out.I'll click the trigger and there's the video.Another way to usetriggers with a video is to createyour own media controls to play it.Each of these controls is atrigger, I can Play, Pauseor Stop the actionusing animation effects.To create the controls, Ifirst insert a shape to serveas a control or trigger.For example, for a Play control I'd use this Action button.For the Play effectitself, I'd first remove the automatically assignedtrigger for the video, then I'd select the video and fromthe animation gallery choose a Play effect, part of this groupthat is available for a video.With the Play effect applied Ican now assign a trigger to it.The Play effect is selected so I'll click Trigger, On click of and choose the Action button.I'd follow the same steps using the Add animation gallery tocreate the other controls.",trigger give anadvantag want play video enabl start video without click pull video slide doesnt show play use playback tab set play full screen set trigger like thispyramid shape start itin slideshow youddisplay slide click trigger video wouldstart play full screenlet take step step here slide earlier stageiv creat shapeand ill insert videous insert tabvideo video pcthe insert video coversth shape doesntmatt im go todrag slide make small wantnow ill use video toolsand playback tab ill select option play full screen howev there critic issu need way start video im go open anim pane help explain what go onil zoom littl morepowerpoint treat videoand sound effect effect repres video like effect appearsin anim panealso shown alreadi atrigg movi triggerin word itsautomat set haveto click movi play sinc dont want video appear play ive pull slide need way start ither one option theplayback tab chang click automaticallynow look effect inth anim pane play effect start videoautomat play full screenlet see preview video play full screen start instantli bypass view slidein case want todisplay slide shape messag appear need trigger video slidegiven ill remov automat play effect set shape triggeri make sure video effecti select anim pane click trigger click ofpyramid shapenow pyramid shape isth trigger video that needto click start itlet tri outil click trigger there videoanoth way usetrigg video createyour media control play iteach control atrigg play pauseor stop actionus anim effectsto creat control ifirst insert shape servea control triggerfor exampl play control id use action buttonfor play effectitself id first remov automat assignedtrigg video id select video fromth anim galleri choos play effect part groupthat avail videowith play effect appli ican assign trigger itth play effect select ill click trigger click choos action buttonid follow step use add anim galleri tocreat control
Trigger text to play over a video,"In PowerPoint, you canmark points in a video usingbookmarks and then use thebookmarks to trigger effects.One effect is a textoverlay that appears on the video;as the video plays a line oftext fades in and then fades out.The text effect is triggered bytwo bookmarks I've set on the video.The first one triggers the text fading in, the second one triggers the text fading out.I'll recreate theseeffects so you can see each step.Here's the slide at an earlier point, I've inserted the video and this is the text I want to play.To add the bookmarks I select the video and click the Playback tab in Video toolswhich is where I find the Add bookmark command. I'll use this Play bar to set the bookmarks. I click the Play control and pause where I want the text to fade in, about here.Then I click Add bookmark.I click Play again to resume the action and pause where I want the text tofade out, about here.I'll add the second bookmark there.So the bookmarks are in place, nextI'll add the text animation effects.I'll open the Animationpane to help with that.The effect that's hererefers to the video, which getsset up automatically as itsown trigger when I insert it.The animation effects that I needto add will go on this text box.To apply the effects firstI'll apply a Fade entrance and then I'll click Add animation andadd a second effect, a Fade exit.I don't want the fadesto be too fast, so I'll select them and increasetheir duration a little bit.When I click Play all, you cansee that the text fades in and out.The last step is to make thebookmarks trigger the text effects.I'll select the firstfade effect, the entrance,then I'll click Trigger, point toOn bookmark and choose Bookmark 1.Now I'll select the fadeexit, click Trigger, On bookmarkand choose Bookmark 2.Each fade effect is nowtriggered by a bookmark.The final thing I'll do is move the text up a bit on the slide so it doesn't crowd the video.Let's play the slide.I click the video to start itand there's the text fading in and fading out.

Create a flow chart,"You want to show aprocess flow that uses standardflowchart shapes you can format andarrange in a very specific layout.To do that in PowerPoint,you click Insert, Shapes and build a chart usingshapes from the gallery.Specifically use theFlowchart group for the shapes andthe Lines group for theconnectors between shapes.As a visual aid for sizingand positioning shapes, click View and check Grid lines.Back on the Insert tab,Shapes, to choose a shape, point to it for a screen tip tosee its intended purpose.For example, the rectangleis a process shape used forthe main steps in the process.The diamond is the decision shape, used to show a decision point in the process and the elongated oval is a terminator shape used to start and end the process.You want to be sure to use theright shape for the right purpose.To insert a shape, click it anddrag the crosshairs to draw it.Once you've drawn theshape, it's selected and the Drawing tools Format tab appears.Use the Format tab to apply stylessuch as a different shape outline.To save the style for all your shapes, right click the shape and chooseSet as default shape.We detail shape formatting in movie 2- Draw and format flowchart shapes. The Shapes gallery is also available on the Format tab in the Insert shapes group.I'll click More to display it and I'll insert a process shape. As I draw, I'll approximate a size relative to the first shape.To match the width of thefirst shape, I'll drag a sizinghandle to the left and watchfor this smart guide, a red line that appears when theedges of the shapes align.Next, I'll use Shape fillon the Format tab to give the process shape a unique fill color.Before I connect the shapes,I'll make sure their center points are aligned, I'll press Ctrl to select both shapesand on the Format tab I'llclick Align objects, Align Center.With the shapes aligned,I can draw the connector.Let's zoom in a little bit.In the Shapes gallery,under Lines, I'll click Arrowthen I'll draw the arrowfrom the center handle on the first shape to the centerhandle on the shape below.Using styles on the Formattab, style the connector justlike other shapes, using shape outlinefor example to change the line style.Then right click and setthe style as the default line.We'll work with connectorsin movie 3 - Align flowchartshapes and add connectors.A final note, if you have avery large chart with upwardsof 25 shapes, considerbreaking it into two or creating it in Microsoft Visio.",want show aprocess flow use standardflowchart shape format andarrang specif layoutto powerpointy click insert shape build chart usingshap galleryspecif use theflowchart group shape andth line group theconnector shapesa visual aid sizingand posit shape click view check grid linesback insert tabshap choos shape point screen tip tose intend purposefor exampl rectanglei process shape use forth main step processth diamond decis shape use show decis point process elong oval termin shape use start end processy want sure use theright shape right purposeto insert shape click anddrag crosshair draw itonc youv drawn theshap select draw tool format tab appearsus format tab appli stylessuch differ shape outlineto save style shape right click shape chooseset default shapew detail shape format movi 2 draw format flowchart shape shape galleri also avail format tab insert shape groupil click display ill insert process shape draw ill approxim size rel first shapeto match width thefirst shape ill drag sizinghandl left watchfor smart guid red line appear theedg shape alignnext ill use shape fillon format tab give process shape uniqu fill colorbefor connect shapesil make sure center point align ill press ctrl select shapesand format tab illclick align object align centerwith shape alignedi draw connectorlet zoom littl bitin shape galleryund line ill click arrowthen ill draw arrowfrom center handl first shape centerhandl shape belowus style formattab style connector justlik shape use shape outlinefor exampl chang line stylethen right click setth style default linewel work connectorsin movi 3 align flowchartshap add connectorsa final note averi larg chart upwardsof 25 shape considerbreak two creat microsoft visio
Draw and format flow chart shapes,"For my flowchart, I'll start witha slide that has a blank layout.I've added a title andturned on the grid lines.To insert the first shape,I'll click Insert, Shapes.Under Flowchart, I'll findthe Terminator shape and click it, then I'll point to where I want the top left corner of the shape and drag the crosshairs to draw it.I'll keep the shapesomewhat small because my processwill require about thirteen shapes.The shape has a defaultcolor fill based on the current theme; to choose adifferent color scheme, I'll click Design and in the Variantsgroup, click More and point to Colors. I like the blues and greens in Blue 2. I'll click it to apply it, next I'll click the Drawing tools Format tab to apply a shape style and I'll zoom in a little.When I type in text, it's white.So the color style is lighttext on a dark fill, I like that.I also want to emphasizeshape edges so I'll click Shape outline and I'll choose a verydark blue for the outline color.I'll click Shape outlineagain, point to Weight and choose a thicker outline style, 1.5 point. So that all the shapes will have this outline style, I'll now right click theshape and choose Set as default shape.Next, let's think about color fills.I'll choose a uniquecolor for each shape type; to quickly see the fill colors,right click the shape and click Fill.For the Terminator shape,which starts and ends the flowchart, I'll choose a darkblue, a shade lighter than the outline.Now we'll need this sameshape at the end of the chart,so I'll press Ctrl-D toduplicate it and reproduce its exact size, I'll zoom back out.Then I'll drag the second shape over to about where the flowchart will end, using the grid lines to help estimateslide margins and type its text.We've got the start of the chart.For the next shape, I'llclick Insert shapes and this time choose the Document shape.I'll draw the shapeto an approximate sizereferring to the grid toeyeball its position on the left, then I'll drag theright side of the shape and lookfor the smart guide which shows me when the shape edges are aligned on that side.I'll check the left side as well. Let's choose afill for the Document shape.I'll right-click, click Fill and try a slightly different blue and I'll type its text.I've added a couple moreshapes, a Preparation shape anda Process shape andchosen their fill colors.To get consistent shapessizes, I've used the shape Height and shape Width boxeson the Format tab, adjustingeach shape as needed.For the process shape I'll needseveral copies, for the main steps.So with the shape selectedI'll press Ctrl-D multipletimes to make the copies.Then I'll drag to arrangethem top to bottom, left to right as I position them,I'll watch for the smart guideswhich show me bothhorizontal alignment and vertical alignment. I'll worry about perfect placement later,but I can get the shapesvery close to being aligned justby using the smart guides.The flowchart has all itsshapes text and colors now, the last shape we added was a decisionshape with Yes and No text boxes.",flowchart ill start witha slide blank layout ad titl andturn grid linesto insert first shapeil click insert shapesund flowchart ill findth termin shape click ill point want top left corner shape drag crosshair draw itil keep shapesomewhat small processwil requir thirteen shapesth shape defaultcolor fill base current theme choos adiffer color scheme ill click design variantsgroup click point color like blue green blue 2 ill click appli next ill click draw tool format tab appli shape style ill zoom littlewhen type text whiteso color style lighttext dark fill like thati also want emphasizeshap edg ill click shape outlin ill choos verydark blue outlin coloril click shape outlineagain point weight choos thicker outlin style 15 point shape outlin style ill right click theshap choos set default shapenext let think color fillsil choos uniquecolor shape type quickli see fill colorsright click shape click fillfor termin shapewhich start end flowchart ill choos darkblu shade lighter outlinenow well need sameshap end chartso ill press ctrld todupl reproduc exact size ill zoom back outthen ill drag second shape flowchart end use grid line help estimateslid margin type textwev got start chartfor next shape illclick insert shape time choos document shapeil draw shapeto approxim sizeref grid toeyebal posit left ill drag theright side shape lookfor smart guid show shape edg align sideil check left side well let choos afil document shapeil rightclick click fill tri slightli differ blue ill type textiv ad coupl moreshap prepar shape anda process shape andchosen fill colorsto get consist shapess ive use shape height shape width boxeson format tab adjustingeach shape neededfor process shape ill needsever copi main stepsso shape selectedil press ctrld multipletim make copiesthen ill drag arrangethem top bottom left right posit themil watch smart guideswhich show bothhorizont align vertic align ill worri perfect placement laterbut get shapesveri close align justbi use smart guidesth flowchart itsshap text color last shape ad decisionshap ye text box
Align flow chart shapes and add connectors,"We're ready to add connectors tothe flowchart shapes we've laid out.The first step is to align theshapes so the connectors will be straight.The flow of the chart istop to bottom left to right.So, to start we'll drag toselect the leftmost column of shapes and click theDrawing tools Format tab.To center the shapes vertically weclick Align objects, Align center.Next we'll adjust the space between the shapes vertically so it's consistent. Keeping them selected, I'll now click Align objects again and this time click Distribute vertically.I'll repeat these steps forthe next two columns of shapes.Select the column, clickAlign objects, Align center,then Align objects,Distribute vertically.I've grouped the decisionshape with the Yes and No text boxes and the groupI'll come back to it, butlet's select the shapes in the last column and clickAlign objects, Align center.The Distribute verticallycommand doesn't apply to the two shapes relative to each other.Now for each horizontal row of shapes, I'll press Ctrl to select each shape in the row, click the Format tab and click Align objects, Align middle.This aligns the shapemiddles horizontally.I'll repeat those steps for each row without including the decision group.For the decision group, I'llpress the left arrow key tonudge it closer tothe shapes in its row.We are ready to add connectors.I'll zoom in for a closer view.I'll add connectors in theorder of the flow, so I'll click the first terminatorshape, click the Format taband in the Shapesgallery, click Arrow.When I point to theselected shape, black dots show the center point of each side andthe cursor becomes a crosshairs.I'll drag the crosshairsfrom the center black dot downto the edge of the shape below.When I release the mouse,the line stays selected and has a green circle at both ends.I'll click away to see the arrow.Because the shapes arealigned at the centers the arrow connects in a straight line.Now let's format the arrow.I click to select it and on theFormat tab click Shape outline.In the theme colors, I'llchoose a dark blue for the arrow color and to make theconnector line thicker I'll reopen Shape outline,point to Weight and choose 1.5 points. I like this arrow style so I'll right click thearrow and choose Set as default line.All the connectorswill look like this now.To add each arrow connectorI select the shape, on the Format tab, I click thearrow in the Shapes gallery and note frequently use shapesalso appear at the top of the gallery and draw the arrow.We've got most of thesimple arrow connectors in placeand we've zoomed back out.What we still need are elbow arrows to connect the bottom task inone column to the top task in the next.To apply an elbow arrow,I'll select the shape I need todraw the arrow from, click the Format tab and in the Shapes gallery clickElbow arrow connector.I click from the middleblack dot on the side of the shape and drag the crosshairs to themiddle edge of the destination shape.The arrow rotates into theright configuration automatically.I'll add the otherelbow arrow connectors.All of the shapes are connected.Looking at the overallspacing, I can tighten the spacebetween the decision shapeand the outer two shapes.I'll press Ctrl and selectthe outer two shapes, then press the left arrow keyto nudge them to the left.Now I'll drag to selectthe whole chart and click the right arrow key to move it to the right, referring to the grid to even out margins.Let's look at thechart in slideshow view.The flowchart is finishedwith every step and connectorformatted and in place.",readi add connector toth flowchart shape weve laid outth first step align theshap connector straightth flow chart istop bottom left rightso start well drag toselect leftmost column shape click thedraw tool format tabto center shape vertic weclick align object align centernext well adjust space shape vertic consist keep select ill click align object time click distribut verticallyil repeat step forth next two column shapesselect column clickalign object align centerthen align objectsdistribut vertically group decisionshap ye text box groupil come back butlet select shape last column clickalign object align centerth distribut verticallycommand doesnt appli two shape rel othernow horizont row shape ill press ctrl select shape row click format tab click align object align middlethi align shapemiddl horizontallyil repeat step row without includ decis groupfor decis group illpress left arrow key tonudg closer toth shape roww readi add connectorsil zoom closer viewil add connector theorder flow ill click first terminatorshap click format taband shapesgalleri click arrowwhen point theselect shape black dot show center point side andth cursor becom crosshairsil drag crosshairsfrom center black dot downto edg shape belowwhen releas mouseth line stay select green circl endsil click away see arrowbecaus shape arealign center arrow connect straight linenow let format arrowi click select theformat tab click shape outlinein theme color illchoos dark blue arrow color make theconnector line thicker ill reopen shape outlinepoint weight choos 15 point like arrow style ill right click thearrow choos set default lineal connectorswil look like nowto add arrow connectori select shape format tab click thearrow shape galleri note frequent use shapesalso appear top galleri draw arrowwev got thesimpl arrow connector placeand weve zoom back outwhat still need elbow arrow connect bottom task inon column top task nextto appli elbow arrowil select shape need todraw arrow click format tab shape galleri clickelbow arrow connectori click middleblack dot side shape drag crosshair themiddl edg destin shapeth arrow rotat theright configur automaticallyil add otherelbow arrow connectorsal shape connectedlook overallspac tighten spacebetween decis shapeand outer two shapesil press ctrl selectth outer two shape press left arrow keyto nudg leftnow ill drag selectth whole chart click right arrow key move right refer grid even marginslet look thechart slideshow viewth flowchart finishedwith everi step connectorformat place

Build an org chart using SmartArt Tools,"We built a portion of ourorg chart with the text paneand we detailed this in movie 2-build an org chart using the text pane.To complete the chart, let'sturn to SmartArt tools which appear whenever I select the chart.Using the design tab willcomplete the chart and apply a SmartArt style and color scheme.We still need to add thepeople who report to each manager.I start by selectingthe manager Abbi Byrne.Then I click the arrow next toAdd shape and click Add shape below.This adds a subordinate shape to Abbi Byrne.Also the chart layoutautomatically adjusted, the manager shapes now branch to the left and right.They had been in a vertical stack; the branching helps to build the charthorizontally as I add shapes.To add another shape to Abbi's group, I leave the new shape selected, click the arrow next to Add shape and click Add shape after.I'll repeat thesesteps for each manager,select the manager, clickthe arrow next to Add shape,click Add shape below andclick Add shape after to add another shape in the group.We've got all the newshapes added for each manager.Now we'll add names and titles.I'll zoom in for a closer view.I select a shape and type the name, press Shift-Enter for a new line and then type a title.I've filled in all the namesand titles and I'll zoom back out.Now as I build the chart, Ican work more with the layout.For example, if I had morenames under each manager, the chart would start getting tall.I'll zoom in for a closer view.To change the layout forthese tall stacks, I'd select the shape above the group Iwant to change, in this caseAbbi Byrne, then I'dclick Layout and choose Bothto make the shapesbranch to each side.I do this for eachgroup, building out the charthorizontally and opening upspace for more shapes below.Let's zoom in and look at ways to move shapes in the chart.If I want to move Abbi andher reports to the right of Silas's group, I click Abbi Byrne, Move down.Promoting and demoting shapescan be less straightforward.Let's say Dominique Kempwho reports to Silas gets promoted to manager; I'll select Dominique and click Promote. Dominique hasmoved up to the manager's level but her fellow engineer Kirby now reports to her rather than Silas. Let's say this is correct and in fact Silas is changing divisions.I can select Silas and pressDelete and the chart will be right, but if Silas is staying and Kirby still reports to him, I'd promote Dominique this way.I'd select Silas, clickthe arrow next to Add shapeand click Add shape after.That inserts a new blank shape atthe manager's level next to Silas.Then I delete Dominique's info and type her name and new title in the new shape.I'd leave Dominique's old position to be filled in.The chart is complete and I'veinserted a text box for the slide title.Now I'll make the chart a little bigger, I'll click to select it, point to a corner anddrag the double-headed arrow cursor.To center the chart, I'llclick a range on the Home tab,point to Align andclick Align center.To style the chart, weclick the Design tab underSmartArt tools andapply a SmartArt style.Each style previewswhen I point to it.How about this one, Intense effect?Then we'll click Changecolors and pick a color style.We see a preview of thecolor style when we point to it.If I want to go back to theoriginal look of the chartand start over, I canclick Reset graphic.Using a SmartArt layout andthe range of SmartArt toolsand styles, I've got a crispbold chart that was fun to make.",built portion ourorg chart text paneand detail movi 2build org chart use text paneto complet chart letsturn smartart tool appear whenev select chartus design tab willcomplet chart appli smartart style color schemew still need add thepeopl report manageri start selectingth manag abbi byrnethen click arrow next toadd shape click add shape belowthi add subordin shape abbi byrnealso chart layoutautomat adjust manag shape branch left rightthey vertic stack branch help build charthorizont add shapesto add anoth shape abbi group leav new shape select click arrow next add shape click add shape afteril repeat thesestep managerselect manag clickth arrow next add shapeclick add shape andclick add shape add anoth shape groupwev got newshap ad managernow well add name titlesil zoom closer viewi select shape type name press shiftent new line type titleiv fill namesand titl ill zoom back outnow build chart ican work layoutfor exampl morenam manag chart would start get tallil zoom closer viewto chang layout forthes tall stack id select shape group iwant chang caseabbi byrn idclick layout choos bothto make shapesbranch sidei eachgroup build charthorizont open upspac shape belowlet zoom look way move shape chartif want move abbi andher report right silass group click abbi byrn move downpromot demot shapescan less straightforwardlet say dominiqu kempwho report sila get promot manag ill select dominiqu click promot dominiqu hasmov manag level fellow engin kirbi report rather sila let say correct fact sila chang divisionsi select sila pressdelet chart right sila stay kirbi still report id promot dominiqu wayid select sila clickth arrow next add shapeand click add shape afterthat insert new blank shape atth manag level next silasthen delet dominiqu info type name new titl new shapeid leav dominiqu old posit fill inth chart complet iveinsert text box slide titlenow ill make chart littl bigger ill click select point corner anddrag doublehead arrow cursorto center chart illclick rang home tabpoint align andclick align centerto style chart weclick design tab undersmartart tool andappli smartart styleeach style previewswhen point ithow one intens effectthen well click changecolor pick color stylew see preview thecolor style point itif want go back theorigin look chartand start canclick reset graphicus smartart layout andth rang smartart toolsand style ive got crispbold chart fun make
Create a template from a presentation,"Coho Winery has a presentation that showcases its premium wines and every yearthey need to update it.In the presentation updates, the wine details always change but certain other things in the presentation stay the same such as these sectionheaders used for the wine categories.For the wine descriptions,the subheadings don't changeand neither does the basic layout.To update the slides, itwould be tempting to click File,Save as, save thepresentation as a new one and type over the old content, but having to delete old content adds an extra step to the work.Also, over time, inconsistencies creep in as variousauthors work in the file andincorrect formatting gets introduced.A better solution for theCoho staff would be to turnthis presentation into atemplate and use that as a master for presentation updates.For the content in thetemplate, you'd keep the formatting and text youalways want in the presentation.Where new content needs tobe added, you could leave the area blank or use placeholdertext as a guideline for authors.You could include formattingtoo such as the frame styleon a picture placeholder, to save an author time and help ensure consistency.For the template, you'dwant global design elements in place such as the themefrom the Themes gallery or a background design and you'd open Slide master view,click View slide master to make global style changes to the master and to customize master layouts so they're right for your content.With all the designdetails and content in place, you would click File, Save as and choose PowerPoint template.potx as the file type, then click Save and here's thebeauty of a template.When you click to open the template file, it opens a fresh presentation thatis based on the template.So, to update the Cohopremium selection's presentation,you'd be starting in a newpresentation file, not the template itself.Yet, you'd haveeverything that's in the templateand benefit from allthe work that's been done.If you put the template ona shared site, your team canalways find a current copy thereand download it for their use too.",coho wineri present showcas premium wine everi yearthey need updat itin present updat wine detail alway chang certain thing present stay sectionhead use wine categoriesfor wine descriptionsth subhead dont changeand neither basic layoutto updat slide itwould tempt click filesav save thepresent new one type old content delet old content add extra step workalso time inconsist creep variousauthor work file andincorrect format get introduceda better solut thecoho staff would turnthi present atempl use master present updatesfor content thetempl youd keep format text youalway want presentationwher new content need tobe ad could leav area blank use placeholdertext guidelin authorsy could includ formattingtoo frame styleon pictur placehold save author time help ensur consistencyfor templat youdwant global design element place themefrom theme galleri background design youd open slide master viewclick view slide master make global style chang master custom master layout theyr right contentwith designdetail content place would click file save choos powerpoint templatepotx file type click save here thebeauti templatewhen click open templat file open fresh present thati base templateso updat cohopremium select presentationyoud start newpresent file templat itselfyet youd haveeveryth that templateand benefit allth work that doneif put templat ona share site team canalway find current copi thereand download use
Customize the design and layouts,"When you create a presentation you want to save as a template, start with thecleanest file possible and getyour design in place first.Let's begin with Designand the Themes gallery.For a presentationfeaturing wine I'd like a deep rich theme, I'll try this one.Over in Variants, there'san alternative purple colorscheme for this theme, I'll use that.Next, I'll click View, Slide master to make changes to the Slide master. I'll select the Slide master,the top slide tomake my first change.This will apply to the text footer, the company's Web address should go there.So, let's click Insert, Header footer, check Footer and paste in the URL,then we click Apply.There's the footer textbut let's make it bigger.I'll select the placeholderon the Slide master, click Home, Font size andchange the size to 16.Because I've put thefooter on the Slide master it appears in every master layout.Now, let's make changesto the master layouts.This is a way to reallycustomize the presentation.We'll start by deletingthe layouts we don't want.As long as no slide is using agiven layout, you can delete it.You select it and press Delete.We've got the layoutsdown to 5 and we're going tocustomize one of them, thepicture with caption layout.We use this layout for thewine photo and description.I want to resize the placeholders and make the fonts bigger, the pictureplaceholder needs to fit the dimensions of our cropped photos.To work with it, I'll rightclick it and click Format shape.Then I click Size andProperties and Size.Before anything else, I'lluncheck Lock aspect ratio sothat I can controlboth height and width.Then I'll type in the heightand width of our photos and press Enter. I'll close the format shape pane for nowand I'll click View,Grid lines as the grid lines willhelp me position the placeholder.Then I'll use the arrowkeys to nudge the placeholderover and up justeyeballing the placement.To widen the text placeholders, I'll press Ctrl, select them both and drag the right side.We can turn off the grid lines.To increase the font sizesin the text placeholders I'll select the placeholder, click Home and change the font size for each one. To add more space above the body text, I'll right click the placeholder, click Format shape and Size and Properties. I'll close the size options and click Text box.For top margin, I'll pumpup the spacing to point 2,that looks better.Another useful change I'll make tothis layout is to this prompt text.How about wine name goes here.To rename the layout, rightclick the thumbnail, choose Rename layout, we'll call it Wine Profileand click Rename.We are done with ourcustomizations to the Slide Master.I'll click Normal toswitch back to normal view.Now I could make all thesecustomizations available forany presentation bysaving them as a theme.I'd click Design,open the Themes gallery,click Save currenttheme and name the theme,but my goal is to include slidecontent and formatting as well.A template formatallows me to do that.So, with our design andlayouts in place, let's click Save,name the presentation,we'll call it Coho Premium Selections and click Save.",creat present want save templat start thecleanest file possibl getyour design place firstlet begin designand theme galleryfor presentationfeatur wine id like deep rich theme ill tri oneov variant theresan altern purpl colorschem theme ill use thatnext ill click view slide master make chang slide master ill select slide masterth top slide tomak first changethi appli text footer compani web address go thereso let click insert header footer check footer past urlthen click applyther footer textbut let make biggeril select placeholderon slide master click home font size andchang size 16becaus ive put thefoot slide master appear everi master layoutnow let make changesto master layoutsthi way reallycustom presentationwel start deletingth layout dont wanta long slide use agiven layout delet ityou select press deletewev got layoutsdown 5 go tocustom one thepictur caption layoutw use layout thewin photo descriptioni want resiz placehold make font bigger pictureplacehold need fit dimens crop photosto work ill rightclick click format shapethen click size andproperti sizebefor anyth els illuncheck lock aspect ratio sothat controlboth height widththen ill type heightand width photo press enter ill close format shape pane nowand ill click viewgrid line grid line willhelp posit placeholderthen ill use arrowkey nudg placeholderov justeyebal placementto widen text placehold ill press ctrl select drag right sidew turn grid linesto increas font sizesin text placehold ill select placehold click home chang font size one add space bodi text ill right click placehold click format shape size properti ill close size option click text boxfor top margin ill pumpup space point 2that look betteranoth use chang ill make tothi layout prompt texthow wine name goe hereto renam layout rightclick thumbnail choos renam layout well call wine profileand click renamew done ourcustom slide masteril click normal toswitch back normal viewnow could make thesecustom avail forani present bysav themeid click designopen theme galleryclick save currentthem name themebut goal includ slidecont format wella templat formatallow thatso design andlayout place let click savenam presentationwel call coho premium select click save

How to collaborate: work together or assign parts,"Hello and Welcome to the short training session or an office move training. This sessions related to usage situation and a particular one is entitled how to collaborate work together and assign parts. My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this short session.So, in this mix session will look at a particular situation and then we'll see how different products from the Office. 365 subscription can help us deal with the situation will start by looking at OneDrive and move on to the OneNote and finally we'll see how your mother social network for business is going to help us.This is a presentation about use possibilities and you can use the rest of the mood curriculum, which we're looking at later as a training action going forward.So this is our situation you're preparing a new company charter with a new internal regulations. The best way to ensure everyone's compliance and support with that is to involve as many people as possible in the creation of the content in the 1st place. However, it's not really feasable to travel to every location to ask everybody's opinions and to get their input and email responses or.These will take too long, so let's see how the various Office 365 tools can help us in this regard, but will start with a brief introduction to the Office 365 environment.So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft that gives organizations a cloud based environment, not only for communication with colleagues and collaborators working together collaboratively but also for the storage of files and documents. It also provides organizations with a cloud based mail service so exchange online cloud based communication tool and service through Skype for business.And cloud based websites through SharePoint online and not only that, but also with your subscription you get online versions of the office applications.Such as word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote.So you can access your Office 365 subscription by navigating your web browser to portal dotoffice.com and this could be done for all kinds of devices such as PC's notebooks tablets and my balls. For example, when you log into that URL and connect to your subscription your tenancy will take you to your home page or landing.The click the icon in the top left corner, which you've too. Commonly is the start menu. Online or on the home page itself. You can click one of the different tiles that are available to access the various available. Services such as your mail and calendar and OneDrive Yammer and the online applications such as word, and PowerPoint in OneNote and so on.We look at that live online demo environment now.So he's Office 365 subscription and we can see the various styles that you can click on to access their various applications like mail and calendar and people OneDrive share point sites. We can also see the tiles for the online versions of office applications like word Excel PowerPoint. OneNote top left corner is where we can see our start menu online or so.And that has again all the tiles are available that we can launch from that start menu. So this is the button. You use in the top left corner to move from app to app cluster in those applications. You can move quickly from your mail to calendar or calendar to OneDrive or whatever, whichever tile whichever app. You want to use you can see that these tiles are modifiable has a hover over.3 button 3 dotted button which is called the ellipsis button. You click on that do things like modify their which apps are pinned to that launch button, so if I unpin the planner for example, I can click on view all my apps.And then get give me a list of all my applications that I can add to the.Start menu up there so for example, if I wanted a different tile that they want to swap the pain of tile that we had on there before let's choose the store tile and said I could pin that to the app launcher and they're going to click on the top left, you'll see the store tile is now I did there. Anytime you can move back to the home at home landing page again by clicking on the Office 365 link up here as well.Initial page.And a few things we can do on him in terms of modifying the look, feel and the settings. So on the cog icon up here click on that to get to access the settings. You can modify your theme you can see that some of them are animated to the one we got here called jellyfish for example, that a major theme. There's lots of different colors and themes and so on so.Cats and robots and bricks and what have you so you could select a different theme if you want to apply different things like bricks like say going to con save and you can also modify he'll start page. So rather than landing on this default Office 365 home page. Click on start page. And then from the drop down list. You can select a different app to start with so if you commonly go.As your first port of call in morning. You work with and you can choose that as your landing page. We need to log into Office 365 click on save and the next time you access the portal that will be your start page. Rather, this page. There's a few other things on those work notifications passwords language time zones, etc. For the moment that will do will just show you now you can quickly move around those at.You can click on the start button in the top left corner click on mail wanted your mail app.And you'll see that that theme that we just selected the bricks themes or permeates throughout the different component. Parts of outlook. So here in our mailbox again. We can click up here again go to calendar.And again, you'll see the same thing that the calendar app has the same look and feel to it.Man uses the same theme.We gotta get back to homepage again just click on Office 365 to go back to initial learning page again.I can just head back to the slides for moment.So and in office weeks 5. We saw the URL to connect to to connect the portal portaloffice.com. We saw the tiles available from the start menu. Online or we could modify that start menu as well to add different app tiles to that, launching button. It is going to get the first of the 3 key components of Office 365 they want to look.Situation the first that being the OneDrive tool so OneDrive is online storage capability provided with Office 365 and it allows you to access your documents from anywhere at anytime from different types of devices. It can make working at clapboard server, you much easier even when you're working.So it's easy to download a document to work with it offline or work with it online as well as we'll see in a moment the demo. So when you select a document right click on it or selected you can see on the screen here, you can do various things to it. You can preview the document. You can open the document, either in the online version of the office application.Full version you can share the document with people or by using a link again will show you that in the demo and you can see that the current permissions on a document have shared with that sort of thing you can also download it locally and you can also view version history, so that's quite useful so you can see previous versions of that document and either open them or delete.Pulling back so if you want to look at a restore back an earlier version of a document you can do that, too.So we can see on this slide here, we've got a document selected and you can see some of the options available from this screen. But we'll see some more me look in the live environment environment, so this ellipsis button is one of the tools. You can use to access it. You can also right click on the document name gives you the same kind of capabilities as well.OK, so it's gonna look at that in the live environment as well.So OneDrive to accessible as you can see here as a tab on the home page. It's also accessible from a tile from the launcher on the start menu up here. I've already got a tab open anyway, with OneDrive loaded so also guess which across to that and we can see on here. You got a list of various files and documents that you've stored into your OneDrive.You can also create new files directly in here by selecting this option that create new folders or create new office document file types directly into your OneDrive storage. You can use the upload button here to upload files from your local PC to this OneDrive location and you've also got a sync button here that allows you to sync your your cloud based one.With your local computer so for example, you could take in a downloaded document work with offline. We not connected to the Internet and then when you reconnect again, you can re synchronize those changes back to the online version.So we have some things we can do in here, so you can select a file so let's just scroll down selected document for example, when you select that document you have a menu appears in the top here that you can do things with certain open that file as it's a word file like I've got options. Open it in word online or open it in the full version.I can share the document I can get a link to it download it. Delete move etc. Copy it somewhere rename it and look at its version history. Those same capabilities are available by right clicking on the document rather than selecting it for the menu at the top you can right click on document.And you can see, things you could do again the same type things that you saw in the menu at the top so open it in the application share. It get link download etc. And 1 more way of seeing that. Same information is to use the ellipsis button here click on that and you get the same menu items. So 3 different ways, essentially of working with that document click the lips.Right click the document name or click on the left hand side to select the file and then get use the menu that appears at the top so let's have a look at some of those capabilities, so she said. You can open. Indiana document so we could open it word online if we do that just launch C word online application.And you can then start working that document from there, so a couple of things to bear in mind. Here is 'cause. We're in the online version how we're looking at online document things that you do modifications. You make a saved automatically so if you notice at the top it says documents saved at the moment. If I then start to type some more text and you'll see that changes to say saving and then a few seconds.So it's being saved automatically as you make those changes. You know within a few seconds and then update and say saved in a moment, which is why they goats document save now, which is why on the file menu. You don't have a save option. You have a save. As so you can save it something else like a local on a local director or something there.Because it gets safely automatically which is different from the way that the sort offline full blown versions work OK, so it's just close that down.So you see so that we can open it, we can as I say download a local copy of it. We can also decide to share it. So I want to share the document with someone.We can choose share and then we got 2 versions of doing this, you can either invite people to share it with C concert starts typing. The name second from the list that appears for your directory and then you can decide whether you want to allow that person to just have sort of read only access where they could only view it or do you want to give them change their capabilities that they can edit the document as well. You gotta couple other?That person has to sign or not whether it can be anonymous and whether to send an email invitation. A lot, so that's 1 way of showing it by directly inviting someone to share and giving them. The associated missions that you want the other way is to use get a link so we get a link. You select the type of link you want. Maybe it's just a view only link or maybe it's needed.We want people to be able to access it anonymously or perhaps you want to sign in with the corporate account. So you can choose different types of link here, so if I choose to view link. No sign in required is essentially anonymous link that people can use to that view it and when I select that it creates a link in here shows me the URL I can just click on copy which then copies it to the.And then that can be used to paste into email message or into a Skype for business chat window or something to paste that link to someone else and allow them to view that file so for example, if I switch back to my office tile and then open mail for example.Items up outlook mailbox, so if I want to then create a new email.I could then just paste that?Link that we just created an ever going into the document and then send off to a colleague and they could then see that and connect that share So what are they after they visited within the email select that link and I'll give them the guess the appropriate location and the guest access token that allows them to get that view access only.OK, it's good discard that message, not going to send it.So that's the way it is safe for sharing that document someone using just a URL link and unassociated access token. You can also set expires on those links as well so they can only last for a day or couple days. Whatever shared option here allows you to show what the items being shared with those who have been shared with.Things like modify the permissions on the advanced button here, which gives you more granular permission capabilities or you can decide to stop showing or someone by using the button here other things you can do.This way we can see delete it move it rename it manage the file itself rename it something else look at its details. We can also see version history, so frickin version history that shows us any previous versions. That document that we worked on who buy does the size change with any comments added you could use the drop down list here to go back?These versions and either just view them. Delete them or store them back again to get an earlier version if you want to retrieve that back.So lots of different options, they have in terms of things you can do to collaborate with other people on the document. Not only can you just work on the document itself, so I can open a document in word online and work for their other people could be doing the same thing, so you can have a true real time collaboration, where more than one person is working on a file at the same time as the file is store.OneDrive and if you both got access to it, you can both work on it. Collaboratively even within the same document on the same page and in different paragraphs for example, OK. Let's go back to the slides from it.So the next tool want to show you is OneNote and that could be used for to in terms of collaboration a particular situation.So you know talk about creating company charter document here so you've got access ability by the users in other words, other people can access it because there's an online version of OneNote as well as the full blown version from the full office suite, it has inbuilt version management and Co Authoring cake.As well so you could use this tool in the following ways to swap tomorrow collaboration by giving a draft document, allowing other people to modify the document by sharing with them, letting them access, it and then you can also view their changes. View multiple authors. So there's some buttons is also in a minute in the demo that show you how you can view the various or.You could also against the other versions of it if you got previous versions of the document as well. So it's a note management taking creation and management tool that let's you provide access to other people. They can then have their input into the document in this case, the corporate corporate company charter.And then see you know what changes they've made which automate those changes and also because previous versions of if you want to as well.So again let's have a look at in the live environment.So we can either open OneNote online from again. The home page. Up here from the start menu or from within OneDrive If you want to actually open an application. So here we got this company chance document. It's not actually a company charter document, but we're just going to use it for the demo, I can then select that document.Choose open in OneNote online.That then open the OneNote online application for us.And we can then see the document that moment. So it's got you know heading a piece of text a graphic another link inside it. For example, moment and you can then obviously make changes that document and make additions to it. But if you want. Other people to have input into that document as well. Then you could then share it for other people, so if they can share.Or use the invite people option here to allow someone else to connect to it, so going to choose user 2. Standard is another demo user. We can either give them view only permissions or edited version. They want to get medic permission, so they can actually access document and make some changes to it, and again. We can decide where they want them to be required to sign in eyes.And we won't send an email invitation or not, and we click on share.So that's now been shared with these are 2 DOT standard so if I just.Use the other persons connection.So I'm just going to drag across user twos window, so he's got his OneNote online open here, so there's a white ones. He's worked on recently there's own notebooks and he cums also see notebooks that have been shared with him, says that company charter document for example, we just shared it and select that document.And so we can now sort of see that we both work in the same document note. This pops up, here, saying John Doe is also here so that's my other user and it shows you where which pages on that thing is on the same page and similarly if I just move this out the way for a moment you'll see that I also have but not here, letting me know that you know, someone else is working that document as well.So this other person now can add their own material, so from here. They could say go down to here. Let's not try their own content.So they can make it insert text pictures links online pictures audio even can be uploaded in tears while addons that kind of thing as well. Tables so could I didn't link there for example, you can specify display text so let's.In 2016.I can stages and then they just have to provide a URL so it's just Lincrusta. Their examples just adapt example. But just something so we got something we can copy and paste in really just to show us what we're doing? How can we use it?And use insert and I'm at that and so again what it does. This remember using an online version of a document here. This OneNote application so make those changes as we work on it, so if I just move that out, the way for a moment.We'll see that contents now been added. So we could see it in the user ones version. He can also see that contents now period. The documents been saved online and this is we can get your sort of collaboration tools being used here because you can choose the view options up here to show authors. So if I click on show authors. It will show you little block telling you which.Piece of content being created by what user so this is a good way, then having multiple pieces of content from multiple authors in your team have things been put into this company charter so you can see who's made? What changes in which pieces of content belong to? Who and you can also use the view option here to see page version, so if it's been earlier versions of the document.Those can be linked to down here, you can select the item and then you can sort of restore and delete it. Get back to it using these other options available up here.So very simple to just share create create create some content. Some draft content share the document. Other people team. Invite them to contributes content to it, and then have them access. It online work with it collaboratively and Co. Authoring mode with you and be able to view those changes by viewing the.By showing the authors of those different pieces of content and that's just a toggle switch that turns it on and off so great way to collaborate on a document together.OK let's get back to the slides.So the last too long to show you who is the Yammer application.So after creating your own internal company charter. Maybe you have people voted their pieces of content to it's a sort of moment ago. You've worked on it, collaboratively with other things, you could do with India over to help you within Yammer to help you collaborate around that as well. So you can use Yammer to inform interested parties about dates made the document you can post your discussion.Conversation in Yammer, you can also upload the file so they can see a copy of the fallen at their own comments in the conversation. You could ask colleague again to post the comments about it in the replies and you can also use the Yammer chat tool. There's little chapter within Yammer to quick chat. So, your colleagues about the document or the project. You're working on and so on before we go ahead and.So you can operate around the shared document you can have simultaneous documenting by virtue of the fact we've really seen those capabilities in. In 1 note. We close to the same thing in Word With Co Authoring in world for example, or PowerPoint and you can use the document management capabilities of those other tools will see in a moment and we can preview the document access it down.And so on from within your mass will see in the demo now, so switch back to the live environment.In his latest.Ocean of the charter.Example.And then I could provide a link to that document so you can either upload files you directly from your computer or from files that you've already uploaded Yammer or I could just paste in a link to that, so if I switch back to OneDrive where my company charter document is and then choose the option to share I can just choose that get a link to create a link so again if I wanted like an edit link with people don't.And it is document, I could think copy that blink or for interview link only or link choirs that I log in with the corporate account and you can structure that link you want click on copy.Close.And then post it into Yammer in there.And other people to be notified that consent to the users as well.So I could post like a link like so and then people could just go and access that by accessing the link.When they're in my Yammer Group.Click on the link and then taken flat document.And they can install to edit and work on the document as well, and make comments on it. Or they could just replying to make replies to that particular update Post that have made here so I could just reply to create a conversation thread about that particular document is also lots of other things, you can do in terms of.Sharing things so you can share the conversation itself with other people. She could post that as a shared conversation in front of the group or you could send the conversation as a private message.You can reply to it, you know that that particular post. You can like it. You can do things like follow a person. So if you click on someones name over so I can't follow myself. But if I wanted to follow another person. I could unfold all follow them just by hovering over their name seeing their little contact card and follow them or follow their conversation.You can do other things as well like.Follow the inbox you could follow particular thread of conversation to see new replies posted to your how many inbox. You can choose to email me when there's been that message, you can have it emailed to you directly or if you're not interested in the conversation anymore. You can decide to hide the conversation.You've also got the chat tool down here. The bottom right corner click on there and anyone who's online in the audio particular group is only the service in this group anyway. In this demo environment. But you can then start to chat with your colleagues your coworkers about this particular update so perhaps if you've posted it. They've had to look at it. They've been some replies in here and you can have a chat with.Tit and collaborate in that manner as well.Let's go back to the slides.So the tools you've looked at briefly in this sessions. It can help you to share and collaborate with your coworkers on documents online or offline OneDrive provides that.Cloud based storage location for files that can be shared with your coworkers. We need to be sorted from OneDrive. You cannot open documents in the full office version on the online version of the app to both sort of un oh and or edit them. That includes working in real time collaboration with other colleagues on the same document simultaneously by using those coaching capabilities of the office applications.When when those files are stored in online and you're working on them as online files either Monday or windows. SharePoint document library. For example, you can use OneNote online to create drafts. We document and have other people tried content. That document review. This changes you'll see, those modifications by multiple authors and you can also use.To manage quick and easy notes yourself related to that particular document or project and you can then use Yammer to post updates about documents or projects unity working on review replies in that conversation thread related to that document and also store. You can upload copies of those files, either linked to the more upload local copies from your.Into the Yammer post so team members can view those documents comment on them in the conversation thread as well, and lastly. We saw we can use the chat tool to chat with your coworkers again and collaborate with them in that way about updates to your documentation.So there are several post trading resource available T to Suffern Hardshaw Mick training experience.

Find what you need my name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this sort session.In this makes session will look at a particular situation and then see how different products in Office. 365 subscription can help us deal with the situation will start by looking at OneDrive. Then Yeah, Matt and finally we'll see how death can help us. It's a presentation about use possibilities. You can use the rest of the curriculum which will look at.Any action going forward.So this is our situation your coworkers are distributed across different locations and some of them are telly working. You don't want to base. Their latest updates work up codes latest report submissions and you don't miss out on modifications made to documents by your colleagues. So let's see the other various Office 365 tools can help us in this regard, butJust have a quick introduction to the Office 365 environment.So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft that gives organizations are cloud based environment, not only for communicating with colleagues and working together collaboratively but also for the storage of files and documents and so on Office 365 provides organizations with cloud based mail service or exchange online. The cloud based communication tool and service through.And also cloud based websites through SharePoint online and not only that, but also with online versions of the office applications such as word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote.You can access your Office 365 subscription by navigating your web browser to portaloffice.com and this can be done for all kinds of devices such as notebooks tablets, PC's and mobile devices.When you log into this URL so excuse your homepage. Or your landing page where you can either click on the icon in the top left corner.Which we refer to as a start menu online or on the landing page itself the home page. You can click the different tiles available to access the various available services such as mail in calendar. OneDrive Yammer and the office applications. The online version of the office applications such as word online PowerPoint online etc so.That live online demo environment.So here we can see the home page of a Office 365 tenant at an Office 365 subscription and we can see on here all the tiles that we can click on to access the various services and applications available mail in calendar. And so on, and there's are online versions of office applications.Up in the top left corner is our start menu. Online button and this opens up and shows you the sort of tile launch or the Apple watch with a different tiles available notice that when you hover over these tiles. You can see they have an ellipsis button next to them. If you click on that allows you to unpin unpin different tiles to this, launching pad to this start menu.Click there to unpin the planner app from the app launcher. For example, so if we click on view. All my apps. We can then go and select an application from list to add back to our start menu. So we could add the planner tile back again or we get a different one for example, store so click on the store and we click on the little Italy.Nuts and pin tap launcher and if we look in the start menu. Online and button at the top will see the store tile is now on the launcher. You click on the Office 365 link to get back to that original home landing page. Let's do that to get back to the homepage.Just a couple of things on here as well. There's a notifications bar appear if you get recent notifications there appear in here and your settings are available by this cog icon so if we click on the little cold up here in the top right corner and you can modify things such as your theme here so you change your look and feel and the environment, so let's select you can see that's different color?Isn't this various icons and a couple of more animated and Sciences cats and robots and all sorts of things will choose Lego bricks. For example, for this one.Click on save.And we can also change our landing page. I'll start page. So it is set to the Office 365 home page. Which is the page. You can see here we can click on this drop down list and select another page, so for example, you typically go to your mail pages. You'll start put in the morning. Then you can make your landing page. Mail click on save to say that next time we logged in will find.First log into the system you can also do things like modifying notifications and change your password and modify language and time zone settings here as well. We'll leave it at the moment there and so to launch these different applications. You can either click. The tiles on this home page or from any part of Office 365 from any page. You can just click in the top left corner on the start menu.And the selected appropriate tile so it just open a couple of these up showing how quick it is to access the applications and switch between them, so click on the mail tile to prop mail.And we could see how mail application loading from outlook so member outlook is still 3 components. Essentially, there's the mail component. A calendar and the contacts or people as it's known in Office 365 and you can see that the theme that the Lego bricks. Type thing I selected. This is sort of permeates throughout the product is available in each of these products as you'll see so there.The mailbox because then also click in the.Start menu again click on the calendar tile to open up the calendar to 60. How easy it is to quickly switch between these various applications of components and there's our calendars and then we could do the same to switch for example, to people to view our contacts.And again, you can see this theme permeates throughout the different component parts.OK, we go back to the landing page again.And then will head back to the slides for a moment.So that was just quick introduction to the Office 365 portal environment. So we saw the URL to connect anyway. So they can see the different tiles are able to click on to launch those applications and we saw the start menu. In line button up in the top left hand corner. Let's launch all applications by little mini tiles in the start menu.Caitians components and see how they can help us in this particular situation so the first thing to look at is OneDrive.So we wanna drive you can use the online storage capabilities in Office 365 of the one drive service to access your documents from anywhere at anytime from any device. Essentially we got Internet access and that way. You work, and document type searches will be much easier even when you're working remotely so for example, you can click on.Find in the OneDrive storage facility and right click on a document example and open the document share the document. People view the permissions on a document and modify those missions. You can download a document. You can view it's version history of those kinds of things and I'll show you those in a moment in the live environment.You can also use the search tools available in OneDrive to look for sort of relevant content and information and that can be all every type of content or you could just search for people specifically or conversations or even videos so each search can be broken down by sort of content type if you like.So simple refined searches.So you can do a search in OneDrive up in the top left corner just for a sort of phrase or word. For example, and then I'll show you all the documents that have that as part of the title in the document example.Or you can do it more refined search where you can use a search and then insert shoe. Your share point sites. Find the documentation and at the top you can see that it's split into different categories. That say it's in French, but it's it's in all or people conversations or video so you can look for specific types of content rather than just all types of content.Down that search and refine it somewhat.So that's going to look at that again in the in the live environment.Save my office is 5 landing page. You can either click. The OneDrive tile. From here or you can click it in the start menu. All I'll do is actually right click on it, and choose to open in a separate tab so you can leave that home page loaded as well.And we can see if we got the famous files and and have OneDrive location. You can see a few menu items up here that says things like gnu so you can create a gnu gnu types of content word Excel PowerPoint content. For example, you can upload files into your OneDrive folder from local machine and you can also have this sync button that allow you to sync.Hold it with your local computer as well. So OneDrive is like a storage location. Cloud based storage location to that. You store your files and share them with people and so on. So when you click it when you look at a file you'll see next to this ellipsis button. You can do things like select the file over the left hand side here and then you'll get a menu appear at the top.All the kind of things you can do to that file and open it in its application or open in the online version of the application. The office application to share it to get a link to it download. Delete move it, etc. Rename it and look at this version history. You can do thinking will says by right clicking on a document gives you the same capabilities, but in a sort of right hand right click can't.And you can also use the ellipsis button. This little 3 dots next to document to open up the same menu as well. So these are the things you can do to a document for example, so you can do things to say like open it in the application. So you could open a spreadsheet in Excel online. We can open it in the full Excel Version Office. You can share a document.You click on share and you get the ability to share it via an invitation so you going to invite people to share that document. You can give them betas to view permissions, so you can type in the name of the user.And then provide them with the editor. View rights matter message for the invitation as well. If you want to send many limb email invitation till it know they're getting this shared resource. The other way of inviting is rather doing invitation on per person. You can do it via link where you create a link either. An editor review type link and that could be either anonymous.So it can require a sign in with with a couple of corporate account and then you just provide the link is as a copy so you create the link and you can copy that link it's in here.I just painted into instant chat window into an email for example.So if I went into Skype for business for example, I could then.Send a message instant message and then just paste that URL of it just copied from the link in their instant message window.I do that here.Sort of pace it in there just paste in the URL.To that particular document and also provides the access token as part of that link to given the rights whether you decided to give an edit link or reviewing any link. For example, you could also do the same thing and paste into an email and do the same thing there.OK on the shared with just shows you how it's currently shared with and what their rights. Are you can stop sharing from there, you can do advanced permission settings or by the advanced button just gives you an idea the kind of things you can do in terms of sharing that said, you can download it. Sit down at your local copy to work with offline for example, you can look at the version history so.It's been multiple versions of that document you can see who's worked on it when when it was last modified who buy if there's any comments made on it, and you could even use the drop down list and then sort of get back in time to the other view the older version. Delete it or even restore back. The older version. If you want to need to so that's quite useful so I don't wanna drive.Nothing will show here is to do with searching superior to our situation. You want to search for content. So you gotta search button up in the top left corner. This is in the new version. This is so that you can. This is the standard version of search so I could do in a search in there for test for example, and that will come up with a list of apps documents that have the word testing or other parts of the body.You can then either select one that's found in the list. We click on search. Everything and that will then return a list of all those documents and you could then you look for the one that you that you think are most interested in another way, doing a more refined search. This is all types of documents and folders and different things. Here is to use the classic OneDrive so that's good.Corner could return to classic OneDrive shows you in a slightly different version of OneDrive is of you.I won't use the search tool in there.To do the same thing, so again if I you search up there.And then to search everything so it's very similar in doing so, you can click on search everything.It will then give you this web page with the documents in and you can look at previews of those documents are hovering over them you can also then filter your your search results by rather having on all results. You can do it by people. So it's only people that have the word test in the name for example, or conversations that have.That word in there with none of those anyway. But more videos, that have the word testing as well. So there might be some video content that are looking for that has a that key word for example, it OK.Just got back to OneDrive again.OK so you can use that as I said, OneDrive for you know quick searches when you're looking for relevant content and information for example using keywords and might only use it. Can I search by documentation, but also for people conversations and videos as well? Let's head back to the sites for moment.So originally we saw the simple search. We just type in the sort of menu. When you view of an drive. You type in a word, and just get all the documentation. They have that word in like keyword in returned and they refined search is the one where you can look for results of a certain type so either by file type or buying whether it's all.All results or just people are just conversations just videos and that's up there.So the next we're going to look at his yama.So for example, we want to your colleagues publishes a document hammers are very useful tool for informing all those relevant interested parties and contacts quickly and simply about those latest updates.So a very simple to use again, you can do searching within Yama and you can sort of search for content regardless of you know if you don't know where it's located doesn't matter. You could use the global search box to find content regardless of where it's located sort of global search or if the document stated in a particular group. You can use targeted search within the groups in.And you could do things in terms of following uses and following contents. When you find something out that documentation are interested in you? Can follow that or if you find a user you're interested in following you can follow that as lots of that social networking aspect to yama?So we have a look at what we can do in Yammer in the live environment now.So, just like other applications, Jammers available as a one of the tiles on the on the start menu. And on the home page. This iama has it same tile so you can see in here looking at this Yammer Group.And I can post updates, so I can.Post updates bounce documentation have you seen this latest report for example.And then I could decide who I want to post this update do you want to see this notification this update so it can be all company just sort of cultural group or I can add specific people from the list. In my group as any competent people in this group as happens anyway. But I can add people individually. So I could get rid of the old company, if I only only one.Vivian and a couple other people in my team for example, I can then also add the file so I could uh profile.Document.So this happened, it as a sort of American then to send that offers a post.So there's my post just been updated so people can then you know when they're browsing the group can see that life just reposted it. They can do other things. Well, they can do. Lots of social networking things like like like the conversation reply to it share the conversation, so you click on share and you can share it with another group by posting in a different group or you can send it to private message to someone.You can also click on the ellipsis button here and so you feel the things you could do so stop following a conversation view the entire conversation. Bookmark it for reference. Later on, you can have a email that message to yourself and you can hide the conversation. If you're not interested in it or delete it if it's one that you posted.Now you can also do things like follow people so you can hover over the person so if I hover over Vivian for example, over here, you can see that I can see it a little contact card about that user mobile number work number email address. And so on, and I could then also follow that user so I can receive future posts in this user by following them.And you can see that I can do the same thing to their their post down here. I can follow it. I could follow in my inbox as well so that means they follow that conversation. I'll get new replies in my xamarin box and that yammering boxes up here by the way in the top left corner. Next your home button is the inbox button and that's where you can see your messages that come through.Positions you're interested in that you're following off from people's private personal messages as well as also notifications button here that tells you about notifications like if you got new followers or you followed someone else or this some new content that you're following related to a conversation that kind of thing.I see it's also search box. I can use Yammer for searching for content. So this is what we wanted us to find some content so I can start just type in a sort of keyword.Search an item.And I'm going to get another select an item from the list. I found also you will search results.I come to you the full conversation, I can just look look at very brief preview of that which is the one I just posted officer moment ago and you can see a good option.Do things like share that again. So I get the same sort of share this with a group or send it via private message.Anna can also download that document, I can go to the file and open it, I can follow document if I followed it already as well, or conversation.I can also click on the file itself just click on that link to file that opens up in word online. So I can preview it. So you can hear it, see here that we sort of have an interaction between word online and Yammer itself, so this is like a small word online preview page. Within Yammer and I can then browse through that document you can see.Give me a print it download as PDF.Feel the things will get help on it, so and also down the right. You can still see it. The same sort of capabilities for sharing it downloading as well. I'm going to file properties from here.Slick in across up here to close it down again.And you can also see him, yeah that you can have their group, so you can get suggested groups. You can join groups. You can browse for new types of groups. You can create your own group and that kind of thing to join existing groups to collaborate with other people and with the content they're producing so typically have a team.Group or something like that, they're working on this field, things you can do also anytime with just posting updates. You can have poles. You can create your own polls in here, you can praise people so you can praise a person select some type in the name.And then you could use these sort of icons in here to this idea would be praising for so perhaps some good work on project or something like that, and you can also do announce this as well to announce things again to the company or to specific people by supplying their names up here.And the loss of interest to chat box. You can see the bottom right corner here search. The chat box. Open up that shows you which people online from your group now and you can start to chat with him within that, so if you're collaborating on a bit document. Perhaps you just uploaded it and then people started to reply and comment on that document you could then have also converse.The chat window down here as well.OK let's get back to the slides again.So you're going to help us in terms of looking for content finding the latest publications of report and documentation using the searches to find people subject. Some groups that were interested in and we can then follows conversations follow those people.And the last piece are going to look at is the Dell product.So still looking for information on the latest publications and and updates, so delve is helps us. Discover information that is most interesting to you so sore right across the Office 365 environment. So you can use it to find information again about people and then help others to find you and also to find other documentation. You could do things that you can click on someones name or picture.What organs they currently working on learn more about them you don't have to know the title of a document or it's stored used Delta collects information for you based on the content that's available shows you the documents whether this stored in OneDrive for business, or site in SharePoint online Office 365.So when you get this sort of gathering information. An overview of that content. You can see here for example, we've got some pages where there's some French lie, but I'll show you the English one moment that shows you these contact with these cards of content content cards and you can click on them and say.Abort and we could use boards in Delta Group and share related documents so for example, you can create a board collector project documents of your team and then board sort of make it easy to collect to discover content and they're easy to share with other people too. You can also as you track documents and find contact you like you can add to your face.Document your favorite you can add aboard your favourites and then when you find it just to just click on the star in the top right corner have a contact card and add it to a favor board in that way. Only Dell venue shows you documents that you've already got permission to access so you won't see content that isn't available to you so that it takes away their frustration of trying to click.Access them when you don't have access to them, so only shows you to stuff that you have access to an permission to view and any other people again. We have to see any of your private documents. If you haven't given them rights to do so. So let's have a look now in their lives over and see how it's not easy to find people in documents Internet. I'll just show you that.Let's we had to contact how to board to show you what it looks like on the in English page. There's a place some of these sub content cards here and you can click on the stars up in the top right corner to add them to your favourites and you click on the add to boarding at the bottom to Adam to a board or to create a new board and then start to build up content that's evident.But in in Delph, so let's show, you that in the live environment what it looks like.So again Delph has its home tile on here, you can see the delft. I like what you got one open in the next tab. So to switch over to that, so this is what day looks like on the home page for user so I think on home here. This is the page are actually already could call me. It shows you. That person is PPS relates to and showed him face melt their profile.You can see where recent documents, they worked on so on, so if I under people. If I got other people. I've connected to before when I want to give you what they're working on so this my team of coworkers could be listed under people like and then click on that person's name see their content information on the content cutting the contact card and I could see documents.Only I can see all and see all the documents have been working on this is where you could do things. Add them to your favourites, so you can click on a button up here had to remove it from favorites. If I go to my favorites list over here now you'll see that this ones on there. So I go back to this page and add this one. Let's go back to that full view.Listen to favorites that will now be added to my favorites in there, so we got 2 documents in there.And it just shows you constantly working on so these documents that have been good as author modified or sent to an email attachment. So it's kind of gathering the information together and it shows you information about the document itself. You know what is created in and where it's located these on a team site summer share point and you can add them to board so you can add this to your existing board.Documents that board in Delcy Kaplica created you sort of team board or something like team.BH list group for example, that then creates this border that certain what I do is just put type in the name of press enter move now got bored listed as well, and therefore when you're selecting other boards. You can then either again create your own board or just click on the board and choose add to that. Port we go and look at the board now will see those 2 bits of content it.Here so I can travel in the team for example, to look to look at will also see boards listed under favorites as well. So again to favourites. You can see we got favorite documents. You favorited and also a favorite board do you favorited?You can also click on these buyers heads you get a bit more information about that particular item.And you've also got search capabilities within delve so let's go back to the top here and then type in.A search phrase example, so I'm just typing the word calendar in there, says now. Give me different results for Canada so different. It's a content they have that verify that word has been found somewhere in the content and then layoff me again to then add these to feet to my favourites up here. So get that. These other documents that I haven't yet gotten my favorite, saying now listed in favorites as well.And notice also want to found a document I can then also actually select the document. Just click on it in there and then all that open up that particular application. In this case word online. That's the word document and you can now see that I'm looking at the document in word online.And you can see that I've got the option to print it and share it had comments to it from here as well.I can also choose edit document and then I get the option of either reading it in the full version of Microsoft Word or I can open in word online within this application. Choose edit in browser and effects are now turning word online into editing the doctor directly using word online tools.OK, we just close that tab down again switch back to delve.OK, so it's good way of finding content and people that you might be interested in related typically rather particular topic or subject or project or client or something that you're currently working on with your coworkers.So the tools you've looked at briefly in this session can help you to quickly search for and find latest versions of your coworkers documents online.You can use OneDrive and SharePoint sites provide this simple search tools to find the files. You're interested in users can use Yammer to share information or post updates, but information about documentation with interested parties to make sure they get the aware of the latest updates and publish publications reports documentation too.To your coworkers working on the same projects together or on a particular client, for example.And then delve can be used to as we solve view that information gather information. Search for information added to favourites. Add it to boards that create boards of interest within delve so delve is really just sort of repository gathering of information from different repository's like, OneDrive and SharePoint sites and so on.To be with that information together.

How to produce: finalize reports remotely with your team,"Hello and welcome to this shorttraining session on Office MOOCtraining.This session isrelated to a usage situation andthis particularone is entitled""How to produce: Finalize reportsremotely with your team.""My nameis Steven Ryan and I'll be yourtrainer for this short session.So, in this session we'll look ata particular situation, then seehow different products from theOffice 365 subscription can helpus deal with that particularsituation.We'll start bylooking briefly at the Office365 portal and then we'll lookat what we can do with Wordonline and Skype for Businessto see how they can help us inthis particular situation.Presentation is about usepossibilities and we can use therest of the MOOC curriculum,which will discuss later as atraining action going forward.So this is our particularsituation: You as well as membersof your team have just receiveda very urgent email from aclient. Soit is essential youprovide a response to thatwithin the next hour or so. To dothis,you need the participationand collaboration from differentcolleagues.Each one offers you knowspecific different elements thatmust be employed in the reportthat your client is waiting for.Everyone appears to be availablebut the only issue is: There areonly two of those six people areactually in your office.So let's see how we deal withthat situation. First we'll have aquick introduction to theOffice 365 environment.So just to talk about Office 365itself, so this is a subscriptionservice from Microsoftthatgives organizations a Cloudbased environment, not only forcommunication with theircolleagues and working togethercollaboratively but also forstorage of files and documentsand so on.It providesorganizations with Cloud basedMail service to exchange online.As part of this subscription,also Cloud based communicationtool and service via Skype forBusiness online, Cloud basedwebsites through SharePointonline and also online versionsof office applications such asWord, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.You can access the Office 365subscription by navigating inyour web browser to portal.office.com and that'saccessible from severaldifferent devices: PCs,And when you log intothat portal.office.com,It'lltake you to your homepage orlanding page.You can eitherclick on the icon in the Topleft corner up here, which werefer to as the start menuonline;Or on the landing page itself.You can click on the differenttiles available to access thevarious availableserviceswhich is your Mail or Calendaror OneDrive, SharePoint andthe Office online applications.So let's take a quick look ata live environment now and onthe online demo environment.So here we can see an Office365 subscription. We're on thehomepageIn Office 365.That issort of the first landing pageyouget when you log in.And there's a few things we cansee on here; We can see the tilesthat we can click on to accessthe various component parts. Sowe got 3 pieces of the Outlooktool here: Mail, Calendar andpeople to your Contacts; We'vealso got access to Yammer tile,OneDrive for storage,SharePoint for websites; And we alsohave some other tools on here likethe Planner and Video and Delve.And you can also see we havetiles for the Office onlineapplications, namely: Word, ExcelPowerPoint and OneNote.We click in the Top leftcorner; This click is your""Start Menu"" online button.We can see that shows us all thetiles that we can again with theapplicationswe can launch viathat start button and this ismodifiable;What's on thislaunchpad here because you cansee as I hover over each of thetiles.This little Ellipsisbutton that I can click on; so ifyou wanted to swap this storetile for example, for adifferent tile, click on thatEllipsis button, choose unpinfrom the launcher and then if wego to click View all my apps,we'll see a list of all thedifferent applications that areavailable for us to add to theStart menu; So let's add tosomething else... uh... the Plannerfor example.Let's click on that andpin to App launcher.And if we go back to the homepage.We can see already thatit is on the start menu.And if Iclick on it now, you can seethe Planners now been added.Let's click back on the Startpage as well.Homepage to getback to where we started.And a couple of things I want toshow on here is the Settingsbutton; So click on the cog uphere in the Top right.It opens  up the settings menu andfrom here, you can do thingslike modify your theme the lookand feel of the environment.Youcan see there's quite a lot tochoose from.Various colorsdifferent themes snow, ice, cats,robots, circuits, all sorts ofdifferent things.We'll try aLego bricks.Or bricks and thensave that theme.We can also do things likechange our landing page, sorather than just startingon the defaultHomepage, this is apage that we can see.Now wecan click on this drop downlist and choose a differentpage to start from so if youmost commonly go to your Mail,sort of your first thing in themorning,then you might want tochoose that as your landingpage.You'll start page toclick on save you can also seeoptions here for things likechanging your password andchanging the language and timezones... We'll leave those for themoment just close the settingsdown.And if I want to launch anapplication.I got the choice ofeither clicking on the tilesdown here to launch one orclicking in the start menu.Uphere to do the same thing.So wecan do either.Let's click onthe Mail app here to open upmailbox.So this is a Mailcomponent of Outlook.And you can see that that themesort of permeated through intothe product as well.Since our mailbox if I clickagain, you can see how quicklyhow easy it is to switch fromapp to app.So I want to go tothe calendar and said, justclick on the start menu clickon the calendar tile.So it is much quicker to go use thestart menu to switchapplications than it is to go backto the landing page andselect on that tileson the homepage.But eitherwill work just the same way.And Lastly off just to showanother one in here, so ifyou want to open peopleduring our Contacts list.Wecan do that as well.And again, you see the themeis through there as well, andwe can see the same sort oflook and feel is available OK.I'm just going to click backon the homepage again.And switch backto our slidesfor a moment.So going back to our slides, sojust look at the portal there inthe tiles available in the startmenu.In the Top left corner.Wealso looked at the settingsavailable from the settings iconby clicking on the cog up in theTop right hand corner.So let's go back to think aboutour situation so.Some of our coworkers are notworking in the office; they're awayin different locations.Therefore, they don't have fullaccess to the full officeapplication suite Office 365still provides them with quickaccess to those online versionsof Word, Excel, and PowerPoint andOneNote, so they can work withthem remotely and collaborateon the projects and documents andfiles and so on with us; So thoseonline apps offer real timecollaboration and co-authoringcapabilities.So in terms oftrust, to sort of finalize ourdocument remotely, not an issuethere.Now that we've got access to theseonline application versions.Andthey also support collaborativework in real time and co-authoring capabilities, usingthe online or the on-premisesfull blown editions.So kick off by looking at Wordonline first of all to see how thatcan help us.So as part of ourOffice 365 subscription as said.we get all the online versionsof the office applications andWord online allows us tosimultaneouslyedit documents.This works not justfor the online versionbut also, if you've got the full onpremises versions officeapplications as well.They workcollaboratively in just the sameway, allowing you to doco-authoring.So when you'reworking on the document at the sametime as another user,You'll seea visual indicator that alerts you tothe fact that someone else iseditingthe document at thesame time as you; And it also shows you the whereabouts in thedocument,they're currentlyworking so now you know...which sort of sections to avoidwhile you're also working somewhereelse in the document.Even onthe same page or slide.You canbe working on the same slide orpage; so as long as you're not workingdirectly on the sameParagraph, for example, block of text as theother users.So up here we cansee thatwithout synchronous aswe said modifications you gotvisibility of that going on soup in the Top right of theslide.You can see that thescreenshot here, which is thescreenshot that you'll see inPowerPoint at the moment to showyou when someone else is editinganother slide in the samePowerPoint deck as you're working on.We also have security of those modifications, one becausewe know other people working init.At the same time, and sortof block us from working in thesame area.But we also have theavailability of using versionhistory.So we can go into.Look at the versions of aparticular document from ourSharePoint site for example.or OneDrive, look at itsversion history and then use itto either view that earlierversion or or delete it or evenrestore it back to a previousversion by selecting the olderfile and restoring it backagain.One other thing also,notice when you're working withthe online versions of documentsis that there's no Save options.There's no file save option.That's because, as you work inthe online versions.Yourdocuments are savedautomatically and you'll seethat visibly that as you starttyping a Word document ora PowerPoint slide; And youmake changes you'll see.Itsays saving and then savedimmediately just a couple ofseconds after it so thosethings happen in on live asyou... as you're making thoseedits to the online document.So we'll switch over to thelive demo environment againand see that in action.So to see that collaboration,real time collaboration action,go to one of the SharePointsites already opened; TheSharePoint site here withdocuments in it.I can see we'vegot some...PowerPointfiles in here and some PowerPointslide decks also got a mailingdocument.And if I right clickon one of those we'll see we getthe option to open it in thefull blown office version or inthe online version of PowerPoint;You can see we can also dothings like download the file,share it... rename, delete or copy.Look at the version history.And so on if we do the similarthing by clicking on theellipsis button here.This opensup more options.We click on thethree dots is the ellipsis.Youget quick preview of that fileso you can see in this case,it's a slideshow slide deck.And as the slide so you cansee, things like you knowwhen it's changed and who isshared within the URL toconnect it.You can open it,share it.follow it and alsoby clicking on the moreactions ellipsis button here.You can see we get the sameoptions as we do when weright clicked on the file sothose same options are thesame ones that you see whenyou right click on it here,so that allows you to say toopen in the full version orin the online version.Similarly, with the Word docyou get the same options.In fact, I would open that on inPowerPoint online first.I'llshow you that and then I'll showit in Word as well.It's not justloading up thatslide deck.We dohave someone else is working onthis file so we should see in amoment when they open it aswell.They will get anotification informing us thatsomeone else is working on thatparticular file.And you see that just poppedup announces appear VivienGoude is also editing.And that will change and showwhat slide they're working on asthey move around the document sofor example, if I get them toclick on slide 2,you should see this updates toshow them editing slide 2, OK.And on their side of things,they show me as editing on slide1, I'll just bring that.Across you to see that.So this is their view,if they see me workingon slide 1 over there.And if I go to the sameslide that they're workingon, IE slide 2.Get them to startworkingwith some of the textfor example.You'll see that now pops up,showing us that Vivien Goude isworking in that section of thedocument.So you get thesevisual indicators that you knowthat someone else is working indid not just that.They'reworking but also that theirwhereabouts in the documentthey're editing at the moment.Somebody could do the samething for Word, let's switchback to Word.And I will open up here.Mailing document.And it will open up inWord online.A similar thing will happenhere will get indicators thatsomeone else is working inthe document as well.So already we can see that Vivien Goude is in that document.And again if I get them tohighlight or something startworking on the text.You'll seeindicators popping out the show,you where abouts they're workingin the document in that time, soagain visual indicators.So youknow that that part of thedocuments currently being workedon and who by.The next thing I want toshow you is the versionhistory information.So I'll just get themto make a minor change.And you can see that changeoccuring on our screen thatVivien has made a change to thatdocument.And notice it says savedup in the Top pyramid in themenu bar, so that'sautomatically saved and.As you're working on it,and you'll notice if Iclick on the File menu.There's only a ""Save as"", there is no ""Save"" option because savesbecause saves are made automaticallywhen you're working directly on the onlineversions of theseapplications.So let's switch back to thedocument library again.And this time, we're going tolook at the version history of thedocument. Click on versionhistory.Then you can accessthat either by right clickingon it or by going to theellipsis and looking at thesecond ellipsis button and nowwe can see the first version.Now we got second versionschange the slight change insize.There may also be someadditional comments.That might have beenadded by that user.And we can see the date and timehave changed.And note, youcould click on these dropdownarrows here... this allows you toview that version.Delete theversion or restore to thatversion as well.OK let's head back to theslides for a moment again.So there we saw how in Wordonline and indeed the otherapplications like PowerPointaligned or we can get that realtime collaboration andvisibility of the effect thatsomeone else is working in thedocument and indeed whereaboutsin the document working and whothey are so you might seesomeone working in a certainparagraph of the report and youcould go into instant messagechat in Skype and also see themin it and then pops of a chatwith about you know whatchangesthey're making and where they're making them and so on, sothat you get real collaborationand the security of thosemodifications by virtue of thefact that one,you can see thatthey're doing, it and whatthey're doing, and where they'reworking and also the fact thatyou've got access to the versionhistory, too.Restore back toother versions or view the changesmade by the people as you'reworking.So the second token tolook at in this part isthe Skype for Business.So you've modified that finalversion of the document in realtime with other colleagues.Youmay want to use Skype forBusiness to alsolaunch meetingsfor discussing peoples tasks orstart a brainstorming sessionwith other coworkers and so on.So Skype for Business is very easy touse, I often get to used the analogyhere for sort of a remotecontrol orzapper that just reallyquick of the button to see ifsomeone's available hover oversomeone's picture to see andinteract with them.So you cansee they're available.You canclick the buttons that pop outto start an instant messagechat.I am chat.You can have avoice call or video call see thatcontact card.And so on, so thatavailability also known aspresence permeates throughoutthe product So what you see inSkype for Business in terms ofavailability is also viewable inOutlook Mail.Calendar.And people in Contacts andso on, as well.So not only is availabilityavailable to you, but also youcanstart over here an instantmessage chat you can start avoice video call and andthere's lots of toolsavailable for collaboration,Wilster in those conferencecalls and video calls thatallow you to do things liketransfer files.Addattachments to theconversation or havingcoauthor on office documentsand also you can do remotepresentation.So you canpresent your entire desktopor an individual program thatyou select or you can presenta PowerPoint file as well aspart of that conference that'sgoing on.So let's again have a look atthat in the live environment.So here we are... We got Skype forBusiness opened up here; we got version2016.We can see they're logged inas John Doe, which is sort of thename used for the userone DOTstandard account.I'm currentlylogged in for the demos and wecan see I can change my status.Here I can sign out or we canset myself as busy or do notdisturb or appear away or I cansign out.Next step as well.From here and one thing.I wantto show you here is that whenI'm I've also got the Office 365app open as well, just to showyou how that's integration worksso if I click on the Mail appfor example, the Mail tile.In Office 365 to launchthe mailbox.The Mail application give it afew seconds to load.And we should see that presenceinformation in the availabilityinformation that permeatesthrough to these products aswell it will take a few secondsjust for the different foldersto load up in Outlook.So you can see here that showingus available, so if I changethat to busy for example, thatwill update again over here verybrief very quickly and again ifI click on away.You should seethat update again.Let's go backto available again.So you cansee that that presenceinformation permeates throughoutthe product and it's sort ofcommon across the products andthat includes also, if we gointo the calendar or to people aswell, the same thing wouldapply.I'm going to minimizethat so we can concentrate onthe Skype for Business tool fora moment so Skype for Businesshere.We can see it's acommunication tool for instantmessaging voice and video calls.And it's laid out into Contactsand conversations and meetings,so the context is normally mainpart, you're working this showsyour?...Current Contacts and itshows you in 3 different ways,so by groups Contacts by groupsContacts by status Contacts byrelationship so in groups.Thesecan be groups that you definealthough it could be sort ofsystem catchall group, soother Contacts is the group thateveryone falls into like acatchall group when you don'tadd them to a group of your ownso if you haven't added intoyour favourites or to a teamdown here or subgroup that youmay have created so I've createda couple of groups down here5SUR5, and a team group and so on.So if that falls into thatbracket.Then they're going toother Contacts and you can alsohave people edit yourfavorites list.So from these usersI've got listed below.Some of them are selected and added to my favorite list, as well.So theyappear at the Top here, sothat's groups, but sorryContacts by group.The status means that they've listed the same peoplebut listed in a different way.They start showing you those who are online.Those who are away.Those who are unavailable.Those who are are unknown, etc as welland the 3rd are unknown, etc as well, andthe 3rdOne is relationships.So when you see Contacts byrelationship.This is definedand determined by theirrelationship with you.As youadd them, as a contact to yourlist.So when you add them,You can say all their friendor family at work colleague anexternal contact, etc.So thisessentially you're looking atthe same information ofContacts, but in 3 differentways by groups that you defineby their current status.Youknow the availability andLastly by the relationshipwith you as a contact.You can also see on here aconversation history thatshows you recent calls chatsthat you've had who with therepresentation down the lefthand side, the icon representsthe type of cool.We knowwhether other type ofconversation was over instantmessage chat or a meeting or avoice or video call.That'srepresented on the left handside there and over here isany meetings again that you'vehad you can set up anymeetings.You got scheduledwill be listed in there aswell.OK to to start key instantmessage chat with someone youcan just hover over their picturehere notice.This is sort ofremote control option herecoming out, he hover over apicture.And you get thesebuttons that allow you tointeract with that user so sendan IM is message chat.Video sorry voice call videocall or view their contact card.So if I click on instant messagehere, you'll see we get hintsmessage window pops up.When wecan start obviously type in thestart chat with that user thatusers not currently online so wedon't need to do that.But youcan see what we can do fromhere, you can see that we canalso transfer files.We can alsoadd other participants at themoment.It's just the two of usin this list.We can choose addparticipants up here and thenselect other people to drag them to the conversation and then click OKto add them to the list.You also got the option of draggingpeople in so you can dragsomeone from this side over hereand add them as  a participantthat way to the list.I leave it as it is for the moment,so we got myself and Guillaume in thisconversation.Other things, Ican do from here.Obviously youcan see I can escalate this sowe may have been chatting abouta particular report.or evendiscussing or working oncollaboratively or we mightdecide we need to have atelephone call about it orperhaps a video call but alsohave the option of presenting soI showed you this one of theslides earlier so you can dothings like have notes or addattachments or co-author onoffice documents, but you canalso do presentation remotely so as topresent your desktop yourentire desktop an individualprogram or a PowerPoint file soif I wanted topresent a PowerPoint file andwork with it with Guillaumeor present it to him at least Ijust select the file click onopen takes a few seconds to loadup and then expands the window,so I drag the window across alittle bit.Let's see that nowuploading into the window.And then expand to allow us tothen view those slides.As I'm presenting that so I'mpresenting this to the otheruser, but it also gives us somecapabilities for collaborationin terms of production tools asyou'll see 2 things do thingslike highlighting and writing onthe slide and that kind ofthing, so I'm looking at theslides here and I can then gothrough the slide presentationas we chat over here in the chatbox discussing what's on theslide?What we're presenting andwe can see we've got someediting tools up here.For annotating so we can do youknow right text and highlightstuff and change the colors and?Size of the pen and that sort ofthing to highlight the thingsare working.We're talking aboutas we have our chat, so thisisn't the same thing as workingon in real time, collaboratingto file a power point file.Thisis just presenting it in ordersort of remote capacity todiscuss it and talk about andannotate as a slideshow ratherthan actually working on thefile directly.And then whenwe finished presenting we canjust stop presenting we'vefinished discussing on todiscuss and hide the stage ifyou go back to the smallwindow again and carry on aconversation and then whenfinishedJust click across uphere to close down thatconversation.And the last thing or 2 andhere's the couple of things onstatus that are up here.It shows yourcurrent status.So this can justbe you know what you're up to todayor I'm working from home today.For example, that kind ofthings, it's just sort ofstatus.Update of what you're upto and what you doing?Where youare, but also want to show theoptions up here.So you click onthe cog icon opens up variousoptions to Skype for Business,or some other general.Somepersonal so things like yoursign in address personalpreferences.How you want yourcontact list displayed you know... in what order...do you want this shown as active... inactive rather whenyou've been idle for 15minutes or do you want to bechanged from inactive to awayagain for further period oftime?There's options forchanging your picture yourphones how you receive alerts.IM options ringtones audio videodevices for collaboration for.Voice and video calls and soon, and other things as well.Like you know recording whereyou want to set yourrecordings and that kind ofthing.OK.So we just switch back to theslides again.So we saw in

Messaging tools and solutions,"Hello and welcome to this Office 365 training.2This session is part of a big topic, which is called “Courses by Product”.3It is related to Office 365.4This session is about communication tools in Office 365.5Welcome to this session.6My name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to maximum 45 minutes together.7What will we be discussing during this period?8Here is the plan.9We will introduce the main communication tools of Office 365:10Outlook, which is the messaging service that you've probably known for long time11from Microsoft and here in its 2016 version.12Then we will have a closer look at Skype for Business.13In fact, not Skype for desktop but Skype for Business.14We will be discovering what's available in this application and communication tool.15At the end, we will see how both tools/applications are Integrated together,16the integration between Outlook and Skype, the close relationship between both.17We will see that in a few minutes.18The goal of this session are to discover the tools that I've described,19tools that will help improve and facilitate your communication.20Along with that, these tools will also add reactivity to your communication ways,21in subtle ways,22proactive ways.23Let's go to the main tool of this session, which is Outlook.24You probably know Outlook.25Quickly, let's discover the interface.26On the upper part of the screen, you find the tabs.27Each tab is related to a group of actions.28Send/Receive,29everything related to folders,30everything related to the view/layout.31Each time you select a tab,32the ribbon, which is underneath,33adapts to what are supposed to be your needed actions and commands34and you see that the ribbon adapts contextually to what you are supposed to be needing.35The part below on the left is the folder pane36with all the folders:37inbox, sent items, deleted items, etc.38The list of emails arriving, I will show you how they arrive.39The order is the newest here and the oldest at the bottom.40On the right, the reading pane41which is by default on the right part of the screen.42Emails arrive here,43many opportunities and possibilities are available in Outlook44mainly to order and organize your emails.45First you can see that they are all ordered by date46and newest. You can click on ""Newest""47and see that the oldest is coming first now.48You can click to get back to the previous order.49It is sorted by date but you can select to have it ordered by sender50or by whatever you prefer;51by category if you use categories...52if you select by from or whatever other ordering.53At the bottom, you have the possibility to show in groups.54This time, all the emails are grouped by sender.55If you right-click for example, on the header of a group56and select ""Collapse all groups"", you've got the list of all of your senders57and you see that some of them are in bold and with a figure58meaning that in this group there are some unread emails59and the figure indicates the number of emails that are not read in this group.60If I open, I can see with this vertical bar61that these 2 emails are still unread.62That's the same in this group: 7 emails are unread.63That's the first possibility to order by date.64If you check this ""Show in Groups"" option65you see that it collapses all groups and everything is grouped again.66Every emails are received normally.67Today no emails have been received, yesterday, Tuesday, Monday, etc.68It's very interesting to choose the order for the emails and show them in groups are not.69It's up to you.70Remember to right-click and collapse all groups to have all the groups collapsed71which is a cleaner view, I think.72That's one opportunity.73Here you have ""Unread""74where you'll see all the unread emails.75That's another option for organizing and ordering your mailbox.76You can still create new folders here.77Once the folder has been created,78to send a mail to this folder,79right click, ""Move"", and select in the list the folder where you want this email to be sent.80Or even easier: you drag and drop directly in the folder.81Now you find it here.82Of course you can send it back to the inbox.83So that is Outlook.84In terms of organization,85to tell you that you can right-click to have several actions.86Among them, you have the possibility to categorize your emails87with standard categories88that you can quickly change, rename, create new ones.89Then you will be able to, for example, give a category to this email.90In this case, this new icon appears in the list of emails.91If you open the email in the reading pane92Here there is a blue bar to show you to which category this email is related.93It's a few things to understand when you have lots of emails already organized and classified94or categorized, it may be interesting to have a very powerful search function95where you can select where the search will be performed:96the current folder, subfolders, current mailbox, for example.97It's very powerful because you don't need to enter complete words,98only a string of characters.99For example, if I write ""teach""100you see that the system is able to retrieve Teachoip for example.101If I select, everything with ""teachoip"" appears.102The search can be performed anywhere:103in the sender name, recipient name, in the body of the mail, etc.104When the search is performed you see that the string of characters is highlighted everywhere.105It may be the sender, the body of the email.106It's a very powerful search and you can use the field above the list of emails.107Be careful to select where to perform search108because if, like me, you have several accounts,109searching several inboxes may take several minutes.110Here are some possibilities for you to order, classify and organize your mailbox.111That was Outlook.112The other communication tool available in Office 365 is Skype.113Skype is available here.114Skype is a communication tool115which is included in Office 365116where you can find your name,117different possibilities with Skype.118The interest of Skype is that inside your organization119everybody can see your availability status.120Here for example, I'm supposed to be available,121but I can say ""do not disturb"", etc.122You can set your location if you want,123show your location to other people,124in this case you can say ""Home office"".125The same here : what are you doing today?126Working from home office, location: Home office.127""Show Others My Location"": if you uncheck this, your location will disappear.128The interesting thing is that all your contacts are available in Skype.129Groups:130the groups are delegates, other contacts, trainers.131By status: you have all the people that are online,132all those away,133when the system does know what their status is134and these which are unavailable.135Then you've got conversations,136everything that you have received:137meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, missed calls and all calls by phone calls.138If you have meetings, they will appear here.139What is interesting with Skype in terms of new ways of communicating that I was telling you at the beginning140is that when you hover over a contact,141some actions instantly appear through icons.142For example, you can send an instant message to this contact.143It's very interesting: instantly you know if the person is available or not144because Skype classifies and takes into account what's in the status field.145I know that Amaury will be in my favorites146but if I go to status, I see that Amaury is not available at the moment.147I can send him an instant message and he will receive a notification of 1 missed instant message,148but at this moment he will not be able to answer.149What is available through these icons, which is kind of a remote control?150You can send an instant message, you can have a phone call through Skype,151a video conference,152see the contact card153and with the 3 dots, you can even have more commands.154For example, schedule a meeting, continue a conversation, etc.155remove from contact list.156The interesting thing is that whatever the classification for your contacts157you instantly know, in terms of communication, which communication way you can select.158When I was telling you about reactivity159that's the point: instantly you can see the persons available and know if they are currently available for a discussion or not.160You can add people to your list.161If you right-click, you can add to contact list,162create a new group163or other contacts to an already existing group like this ""Trainers"".164Amarra is a colleague who is a trainer,165I added her to the trainers group.166It's very easy and you don't need to enter an entire name.167By entering a string of characters168the system instantly adapts and is able to retrieve people whose names contain this string of characters:169Amarra, Amaury, etc.170It's very interesting too171because if you select to start a video conference172you will instantly know if the person is available or not.173""Offline"" means that it's not possible.174Many possibilities are actually at your disposal175in terms of phone calls and instant messaging.176The interesting thing between all the communication tools in Office 365177is that the main ones like Outlook and Skype that I've just described178are very closely related.179There is an integration between both.180You remember the hovering over the contact that shows commands through icons.181If we go to Outlook,182the same will appear in an email, for example, if you hover over a sender or recipient.183You see that it's me, but that would be the same for anyone else:184I'm available and video capable.185Here I have the possibly to send an instant message to this person,186call him/her by phone via Skype,187video conference.188If I select someone else like Amaury,189the same will appear for whoever this is.190Each time there is someone191I know that he's offline192so there's no possibility to send him an instant message193but offline messages only.194I can get his complete card.195In terms of integration with Outlook,196even closer integration and perhaps even more interesting:197if you go to the calendar198in the calendar we will be able to create appointments, meetings199in your calendar.200There is a specificity related to Skype:201if you create a new meeting request for example,202you'll find,203once it is activated,204a button called ""New Skype Meeting"".205if you select this, a close relationship between Skype and Outlook,206in the invitation email, which is the normal way for scheduling a meeting,207in the invitation email, Outlook will automatically send a link208and any person receiving this email,209internally or even externally,210someone from another company, for example,211a vendor, a subcontractor, a client, a customer,212any person receiving this email will instantly be joining the conference213by clicking the link.214where I can use this conversation.215I have myself created a link and by clicking the link I enter the meeting.216Persons receiving this invitation mail, by clicking the link, will be able to enter a meeting with me217and this independently of the device used218because this link will allow the person to enter the meeting219with a PC, laptop and also with a tablet or a smartphone220even if it's not the most user-friendly way to enter a meeting.221But independently of the device because even if Skype is not installed on this device222there will be a way to connect with an application that will be installed in the browser on a PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone.223There is no need for the recipient of the invitation224to have Skype installed.225That's the quickest way to enter a meeting with anybody on earth.226In Outlook, click the Skype meeting button to create a link to send the invitation to someone anywhere in the world that will able to connect to the meeting.227You have 2 examples of communication tools included in Office 365 that will accelerate and facilitate your communication.228It will be a more reactive because if you need to quickly contact someone229inside your organization,230you will instantly know their availability, either through Skype or Outlook,231because if you have someone in the list of your contacts232you've got these 4 items to show the availability of the person to contact them.233You always have these possibilities here.234it's a new way of communicating, more reactive and flexible,235because you are not dependent of one way,236you can choose your way and, even with external people, you can instantly be into a meeting with these persons outside your organization.237These were the 2 possibilities: Outlook and Skype,238the relationship and integration between both systems.239That was a quick but interesting way to discover these 2 communication tools.240Thank you for attending this session.241I hope you can make the best use of it.242Thank you, bye.",hello welcom offic 365 training2thi session part big topic call cours product3it relat offic 3654thi session commun tool offic 3655welcom session6mi name charl

Office productivity tools,"Hello and Welcome to this short training session on Office MOOC training.2These sessions are related to specific products and tools and this particular one is entitled ""Office Productivity Tools"".3My name is Stephen Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this short session.4In this session we will introduce some specific Office 365 products that can be used to improve office productivity.5We will start by looking at OneDrive app in Office 365.6Then we'll discuss the online version of the Office suite.7Finally, we will look at the social networking tool for business, which is Yammer.8The goals of this being to identify those Office 365 tools that can help to facilitate office productivity9and also to have a look at some of the other resource available for this course in the curriculum website.10Before we look at these tools, let's have a quick introduction to the Office 365 environment.11Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft12that gives organizations cloud-based environment13for the communication with colleagues or working together collaboratively14and also for storing files and documents.15It provides organizations with a cloud-based mail service16by the exchange on online service, cloud-based communication service with Skype for Business online17and cloud-based websites through SharePoint online.18You also get online versions of your Office 365 applications: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.19You can access your Office 365 applications via a web browser on portal.office.com20and you can do this on all kinds of devices: notebooks, PCs, tablets, mobile devices.21This takes you to your homepage22where you can either click in the top left corner,23which refers to the start menu online or the Office 365 start button,24or in the homepage itself, you can click on the different tiles25to access various available services and applications26like Mail and Calendar in OneDrive, and SharePoint and the Office online suite as well.27Now let's take a look at that in our live online demo environment.28Here's our Office 365 suite29and we can see the tiles to access the various applications and services from here30like Mail, Calendar, OneDrive and SharePoint.31Online application suite: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote,32or possibily the Office online suite.33We can click in the top left corner to access the start menu34and have access to various tiles35This is the bottom within Office 365 to switch from application to application.36Rather than having to go back to the homepage to access the tiles37we can click on the start menu in the top left corner to do the same thing.38This is modifiable as a sort of launching pad39so if you want to change a tile, you can click on the ellipsis button to modify and choose ""Unpin from app launcher""40and then pin a different tile, so click on ""View all my apps""41and then we can select a different application.42If you want to add the Planner tile instead for example,43click on the ellipsis button and choose ""Pin to app launcher"".44If we click on the start button in the top left corner, we will find out that the Planner tile will be there instead of the Store tile.45To switch back to the homepage, click on the Office 365 link in the top navigation bar.46It takes us back to our initial homepage from where we logged in.47There are few options in terms of settings.48Click on the cog icon to open settings49and we can do things like modify the look, so we can change the theme.50There's a lot of different options, different colors and different types of themes51like circuit, cats, robots and bricks...52All sort of things.53Let's choose one of those: robots.54Then we can save that theme.55We can also do things like change our landing page.56Rather than access the default homepage,57if you want to access the mail app when you first log in the morning58we can do that, click on save,59and it will become our initial landing page when we first log in the morning and it will take us straight to our mail60rather than on this default homepage.61There are other settings as well: notifications,62language and time zone, change password, etc.63But that will be sufficient for now.64To switch to our applications, click on the start menu.65Click on the appropriate tile to open an application.66This is going to open our Mail application.67If you want to switch to the calendar for example, click on the start menu and on the Calendar tile68Switch to the calendar, you can notice that the theme, product, all those different components are both in the Mail and Calendar and in the People69which is already in our contacts.70We can switch to contacts and see what it looks like.71These are the contacts that we can modify and view in there.72Let's get used to moving around the applications in the start menu.73Let's click on Office 365 to take us back to the homepage again.74Then we'll switch back to our slides.75We saw that we can access the portal via portal.office.com.76We can click on the start menu in the top left corner to access all our application tiles77to get access to those applications and various services that make up the Office 365 suite.78Let's look at the first product about office productivity: OneDrive.79What is OneDrive? It's a storage location,80one of the storage capabilities of Office 365,81and gives you up to one terabyte per user82of storage space in the cloud in the Microsoft data centers.83So you can use the online storage capability to store your files84in cloud-based location services85and get access to documents to be able to view them for anywhere,86anytime you access to it, via the Internet on any kind of device.87You can also share your files with colleagues.88That makes it much easier to work collaboratively with other people, even when you're working remotely.89You can easily download documents, work with them offline or directly online in sort of real time collaboration.90If you select a file, as you'll see in a moment in the demo,91it gives you options on the menu to preview, open the document, to share it with other people92either by invitation or a specific link to the document.93You can also view those share permissions on that document as well.94You can download a copy of the document95and you can also view the version history of a document96if you want to open a previous version or delete or even restore back an older version.97Let's go and have a look at that in the live environment.98Back on our homepage.99We are going to open the OneDrive application, click on the start menu in the top left corner100and then we can click on the OneDrive tile.101We can also right-click on it and choose ""Open in new tab""102if we want to open it in a separate tab, which is what I'll do.103We've got a list of files and folders in a storage location, in the cloud.104We can use some buttons across the top menu to do things into our storage location.105We can create new files and folders.106I could create a new folder to store things in. We can create new documents: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, etc.107We could also upload files from a local computer108to this storage location.109We have a sync button as well. That's a sync online storage in OneDrive with a local drive on a local computer110so you could then work on a file offline when you are disconnected from the Internet.111Work on it when you're away from the Internet112and then when you get back online again later you can re synchronize those changes to the online storage location.113In terms of file: if I select a file,114select Document 3, for example.115I select it on the left hand side, so the menu pops up116giving access to various tools.117You can open that application118in Word online or in the full version of Word if we have it119We can share a document, get a link to it,120download it locally, delete, move, copy, rename121and also view version history for it.122Rather than using the menu across the top123you can also right-click on a document and use the right-click context menu.124Another way of doing it is to click on the ellipsis button (the 3 dots)125to open exactly the same menu.126Let's open Document 3 in Word online for example.127I can open the document in Word online.128This is ""Document 3 - saved"" in the status bar and you'll notice if I start to type in some text129it will change to ""saving"".130I could change it and it will automatically save it and say ""saving"" afterwards131because you're working on online documents132being saved in the cloud automatically133on the file as you make those changes.134If I click on the FILE menu135You'll see that there's no save option. There's a ""save as""136but there's no save because things are saved automatically on the file when you're working with them online137on these online applications.138You also have the option of editing in Word.139If you're using Word online for editing, you want to open it in the full version of Word140you have the ""edit in Word"" option which you can use to switch to the full app.141Let's suppose another person also wants to work on the same document at the same time, on another browser,142I've got a document available, Document 3.143If I use it, it also opens the same document in Word online.144In this case it opens in sort of read only mode145if he wants to edit the document. You can see the changes I've just made.146He can then edit the document again. His options are to edit in the full version or in the browser-based version Word online, which he's going to select.147Now I have 2 people working on the same document at the same time,148It pops up with a little icon149to show that someone else is working on the document150and it also shows us with this cursor whereabouts in the document they're working.151So far he is to make some changes here.152Let's change the formatting on that.153And so on, and then switch back to the other screen.154The other person sees those changes as well.155It tells me that User 2 is also editing the document156and I can see the flag there that shows you where abouts their cursor is part of the document editing.157It's a real time co-working and collaboration on that document.158The other thing we can do, let's close it down for a moment,159is share the document.160If I access the menu for that document, there is a share option there.161I can also do things like download it locally and work on it, move it,copy it, etc.162I'm going to share it with someone so I click on ""Share""163You've got 2 options for sharing: you can invite people to a list.164So you can select users from your directory165and decide whether they should have read only access with ""Can view""166or whether they can have change and edit access with ""Can edit"".167You can add a message to your invitation.168You can require them to sign in or access anonymously169and you can send an email invitation to let them know that the document has been shared with them.170You can turn this off if you don't want them.171Click on ""Share"" to share it.172It's already shared with that user so we just had to log in a moment ago.173The other option is to share with a link.174You can create a type of link: edit or view,175either anonymous or one that requires sign-in.176Let's say we want a view link with no sign-in required for example,177you can right-click and copy that link178and then paste that link into an email message179or to an instant message chat window or something.180The person that you're sending that too can click on the link and then they'll get the access181that's been determined by the level of link that you selected in the list.182You can do it more anonymously by supplying a link183or you can do it specifically by inviting a person and applying certain permissions to that document.184The last thing we will see is the version history.185I click on ""Version history"" and I can see a list of who's worked on it and when,186if there are any comments made on the document, changes, and so on.187I can use the list of versions to select a previous version188and view it, delete or restore it back again should I need to.189Let's switch back to the slides.190We saw that OneDrive is the storage location for these files.191It's to upload and store files, view and access them,192share it with other people as we did a moment ago.193Not only that, but it also allows us to access those drives194using the application.195In this case we were using Word online as part of the online Office suite196to access documents.197One of the benefits is that when you use the online version of the apps198and the Office 365 subscription199is that you always get the latest version.200So if there's been made changes to the version of the application201you will get those updates automatically.202If you've got the full Office suite, then changes made to those applications203you will also get updates to those versions as well.204Another benefit is you've always got access to it.205Wherever you're located, you can get access to those applications.206If you're in a hotel, remote office, at home or at the airport waiting or something207you can get access to Word, Excel: PowerPoint and OneNote online,208wherever you've got access to an Internet connection essentially.209Having those online versions, you can view and edit documents without the need for a local installation of the Office software210and you can use those built-in tools for enabling real time collaboration211in real-time co-working capabilities with synchronous co-editing with other users.212We also saw that not only does it let you do that collaboration but also lets you see a visual representation213of a visual indicator of who's working on the document and whereabouts on the document they're currently working.214The example you can see on the slide215is a screenshot showing a flag that opens up to show someone working on another cell in Excel online.216The last thing we want to look at is Yammer, the social networking app for business.217After after you create your corporate documents in Office online apps218you can store them in OneDrive and Yammer can help you collaborate around that content.219You can inform interested parties about updates made on document  by posting a discussion in Yammer.220Then upload the file for comments221and you could ask your colleagues to post comments about the document using Yammer conversation replies.222You can also use Yammer chat facility to have a quick chat with your colleagues about documents or projects you are working on.223I will show you in a moment, you can click the link to a document and open it directly in Yammer224and open up the relevant Office online application to work on a document225collaboratively with your colleagues.226as we saw a moment ago.227so you can access Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote documents from within Yammer and collaborate on them with your colleagues.228I'll show you that now.229Switch to another Office 365 subscription I've got230which has access to Yammer on it as well. I click on the start menu231and open up Yammer in a new tab.232Within Yammer, we can see typical kind of social collaboration things.233We can reply to conversations, like, share a conversation with someone else...234I can share it by posting it in a group or as a private message to someone.235We can click on the ellipsis and stop following conversation,236bookmark it, have it emailed to inbox or hide the conversation if we no longer have interest in it.237We can see a link to a document.238That's a OneNote document for example, it's hosted on a SharePoint site.239We could click on that and access the document directly via the link.240We can see that other people have made updates in here as well241so I can reply to the update, I can follow and unfollow people using these buttons242to follow and unfollow people in that group that connect with me.243I've also got access to the chat tool at the bottom.244I click on that and I can see people online in my group and start chatting with them.245and I can post updates about things I'm working on. If I want to post an update about a new charter document for example.246I can decide who I want to share the update with:247everyone or specify individual people to share it with in my group248and then to all company for example, if I want to.249I can then select the document and upload it from my computer.250Select the ""Company Charter"" doc251and then that's been attached so I can post that to the group.252People can access that document, view it, download it, make comments about it, reply to that.253For example, if they want to click on a document like this one, I posted one earlier about a report,254they can click on that and share it, download it, go to the file,255or they click on that sort of preview to see a preview of the document.256It is in read only mode so they're looking at the document content, they can download and print it and download the PDF.257If they want to edit it, they need to click on ""Go to File""258or on the previous page.259It takes them back to this view where they can open up the document for editing purposes rather than previewing it in read only mode.260I click on ""Edit File"" and it will open in the relevant application.261In this case it is going to be Word online.262Directly within Yammer by updating a document,263sharing  with other people as an update, they can click on the link to the document,264view it and edit it.265When people are working on it in different places266and get that real time collaboration, even within Yammer.267It's just a way of accessing a document by another method.268You can access it via OneDrive or Yammer as it's been posted as an update on Yammer.269Switch back to the slides.270The tools we've looked at in this session can help us improve productivity in Office271and share and collaborate with your coworkers on documents online.272Office 365 itself provides quick access to those apps273via the Office 365 homepage274or via the online start menu.275OneDrive provides could-based location for files that can be shared with your coworkers. You can open documents from OneDrive276in the full Office and the online version for both viewing and editing purposes which includes working in real time collaboration with other people277on a document simultaneously.278You can also use Yammer279to post updates about documents or projects you and your team are working on, review, reply in conversation threads,280upload copies of files in your Yammer post so that members can view the document, preview it, comment on it,281and also open the link in the online version of the application to open them and work on them collaboratively as well.282You can use the Yammer chat tool to chat with coworkers about updates, documents or projects that you're currently working on.283There are several post training resources available to you to further enhance your MOOC training experience.284You can review the recordings of previous webcast sessions, access the relevant video tutorials,285review the usage scenarios and situations and provide feedback on your experience.286There is also access to MOOC specific groups on Yammer for further information to expand your support.287I'll show you where you can access the MOOC website to get that information.288This is the MOOC Office 365 live online training portal.289You can browse your category of courses by use case:290communicate, share, collaborate, search, produce, etc.291By product type: social networking tools, messaging tools, office productivity tools.292Or by the ""Get started"" rang for Office 2016, Outlook, Excel, SharePoint, Skype for Business, etc.293When you select a course294you can see information about your progress through the course, you can use the course menu to browse295other bits of content so you see when your next available sessions are for example,296review previous webcast recordings, review the usage situation videos,297review video tutorials on the products themselves that are part of that particular course.298You can also access the Yammer account to collaborate with colleagues and look at group discussions on that particular topic.299That concludes this short session.300Thank you for attending and I hope you can make the best use of these resource going forward.",hello welcom short train session offic mooc training2thes session relat specif product tool particular one entitl offic product tools3mi name stephen ryan ill

Social networking tools,"Hello and welcome to this short training session on Office MOOCtraining.These sessions are related to specific products andthis particularone is entitled Yammer Enterprise SocialNetwork.My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer forthis short session.So, in this session will look at the Yammer social networkingproduct in Office 365.We'll start looking at how Yammer can be used to communicate andhow it can provide cool string and co-editing capabilitiesand finally how Yammer can be used to enable coworkers toparticipate in the creation of content.The goal being to identify that Office 365 tool for facilitatingand improving social networking.It will have a look at the restof the available curriculum tools for this course.But before we look at these tools that have a quickintroduction to the Office 365 environment.So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft thatgives organization cloud based environment, not only forcommunication between the colleagues and for them to worktogether collaboratively. Also for the storage of files anddocuments. Office 365 provides organizations with a cloud basedMail service, so Exchange online; cloud based communication tooland service through the Skype for Business online and cloudbased websites throughSharePoint online.And also along with that, you get onlineversions of the Office application suite, namely WordExcel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.So you can access your Office 365 subscription by navigatingyour web browser to portal.office.com and this could bedone for all kinds of devices such as notebooks and PC's andtablets and mobiles.Listen take you to your home page or landingpage.We can either clickthe icon in the top left corner,which we refer to as the Start menu Online or Office 365 startbutton or on the home page itself.You can click on thedifferent tiles available to access the various services andapplications, such as my own calendar,and OneDrive and Sharepointand the online application suites; Office application suite.So let's take a look at that live online demoenvironment now.So here's a demo Office 365 environment tenant and you cansee we got our Welcome pagehere, so home landing page.We get access to the online applications.So you can see, wehave tiles here for Mail and Calendar and People,Yammer,OneDrive SharePoint, etc.Exceed also got tiles for the onlineversions of office applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.Let me click on the top left corner. This is our start menu;Start menu Online; or Office 365 start menu.We can click on thatagain.Get access to all those tiles so this is iaccessiblefrom wherever we are within Office 365, whereas these tilesare only available on the on the home landing page.So we'regoing to use the start button to navigate from application toapplication and again we can see the tiles there for thosedifferent services; those different apps.You can also modify that list, if you want to add or removetiles from this sort of launchpad here.We can clickon the ellipsis button.The three dots and choose to unpin that from the app launcher.For example, if weclick on ""View all my apps"".We can add tiles back to itagain.To get a list of all our applications.We can then selectagain.The ellipsis button to add a tile back. So for thatPower BI tiles back.We can click on that and choose pinned to app launcher.If we want to add in a tile that wasn't on therebefore we want to add the store tile. Again, click on the ellipsisbutton, ""Pinned app launcher"".If we now look on the start button.We""ll see those tiles are back onthere?And the store has been added as well. Said switch backto your home page.Just click the link in the Top navigationbar. Click on Office 365 takes you back to your home page.Couple things to shop here : we got the note.We gotta help menuhere.We've got notifications that pops up, and let you knowif your subscription to ending or if you got a new applicationavailable for example, down here, so that's allnotifications.We've also got settings on the cog icon. Clickon the cog icon.We can do things like change our theme, ourlook and feel for thistenants. There is a lot of different color themes as you can see,there, we've got some animated ones.I got some colorful,cartoon style ones, like cats androbots andLego bricks for example. Let's choose robotsand save that thing.And then we can also do things like modify our start page.So rather than landing on this default Office 365 home page.You can click on the drop down list and select anotherapplication.So perhaps you want to start in Mail.Let me log inthe morning in the Mail app.We can do that and make that ourhome page,or start page, when we login.It's also other options and there are things like notifications where they wantreminders and sounds.Also pack change your password and thenlanguage and time zone settings in there as well.OK and then to switch between applications aswe make click on ourStart menu in the top left corner. Click on a tile to openapplications such as Mail.And you'll see that that theme is sort of permeated throughoutthe product sits in the Mailpart of Outlook, as well as it isin the Calendar and thePeople apps as well. So if we switch to the Calendarfor example, click on start menu again.Click on the calendar tile.And we can see that same theme in the calendar there. And againwe can just switch from app to app using the start menu.up here.If you want to click on People to see a list of Contacts.OK, so it's just show you how we switch from application toapplication.You can use that start menuin the top left corner.If we want to get back to homepage, initial landing pageclick on the Office 365 link. It takes us back to that page.And see the bottom page,we get a list of recent documentswe have accessed as well.OK let's switch back to the slides for a moment.So we saw how we can access portal.office.com to accessOffice 365 tenant and click in the start menuin the top leftcorner to access ourvarious applications and services on the Top left corner.So let's have a look at the Yammer tool now that discussingthis session.We can look at in 3 aspects of Yammer for communication, forsort of co-editing, co-authoring andfor participation.So we can communicate instantly using aswell, see a little demo at the chat facility.There's a chatbox available within theYammer tool.We can alsouse the Yammer open office to look for topicsYou're interested inin sort of targeted automatic groups and communicate with our coworkers internally, using internal groups or withpartners; external partners; again who may have a common interestor common need or common project. Perhaps you're working on.You can then use Yammer post ideas and questions and discussions to ateam or group, as a post; as an update; to ensure each sort ofwide range of people who share that common interest; or need; orworking on the same project; or document issue for example.And maybe want to assist you. So let's have a look at that inthe live environment.So first off, we need to open Yammer, so we can either dothat, from home page.Let's get used to using the start menu upin the top left corner.I can click on the tile or a rightclick on it, and choose ""Open in new tab"" if I want to.And Yammer will load up.And we can see in here, we got posts or update.Some otherpeople for myself; from other people in my work group downhere, that we can scroll down and see.There's a few tools to look at in here, so you can... have a searchbox up here, let's you search fordocuments or people or groups.I could search particular person.That view andgood his colleague of mine.And hover over that person to click, and access their details.I can see, things that they've posted; any conversationthey've been involved in or images or files if they've posted it. Notice thatyou can send each other message. Using this button,I can unfollow orfollow from here as well.So I can click on that unfollow andthen re-click on to followagain.Yammersaid just telling usthat from now we'refollowing that user.Click on the home button to get back tothe homepage everywhere.We gotta search box here, so wecould use for finding documents, if we ever lookfor particular document types. Starts typing pass the nameand then you can see the document and access documentto select the document.From there, so let's click on thatto open up the main ""Mailling"" document.Ok, and we will look at this in the next demo in terms of co-authoring,and co-editing.So I'll go back to homepage.That's just showing how you can search for items in the search box.You also got an inbox there, so for messages that come in fromother people, messages from the system, up here in your inbox.And then you have a notifications bell here thatshows you changes in uploaded a new version of a document there.You gotta new follower...That kind of thing will appearin your notifications list on here.You will get a chat box down the bottom right corner.So I clickon that chat box shows you who's online.Currently, I can thenstart chat with them again as you notice.They has a hoverover them that pops up, with this sort of contact card.And we create groups and join groups and view our groups.These groups already created in here default group internalgroup this one. This is an external group.Good ambiance team.And within that group will be get conversation threads, there,maybe files uploaded as well.You can see the members are from this list over on the right youcan search the group and so on.And we can use these buttons down here to create group, soyou can createinternal groups so that's for collaborating withpeople inside your company. You assign it a name or just call ittest or something at the moment use that yet and it will justlet you know with that group names available.Not you canthen start to add people to the list.I started type in theirname at the most group members. You can decide whether it'spublic, so anyone in the network can access it, or if it's private :only approved members can access it people within the group.And you can also create anexternal group.So it's it's for collaborating with people whowork outside your company. Againyou can give it a name.Add people to the list.Set them from recent lists or startstyping theiremail address for example.And then create the group and do it that way again. We got public and private options as well for that.We can't set back to the slides for minute.So not only we can use Yammer for communication with internaland external people will using the chat facility with instantmessaging chat.We can also use Yammer as a co-editing, co-authoring tool.This allows us toinfom interested parties, but updates who made the documents,by posting a discussion.Yammer upload the file for comment.For example, you could ask people to comment on that document.You've seen conversation apply and conversational thread in Yammer.You can use the Yammer chat facility,we already saw before, to have aquick chat with some colleagues about those documents or projectsyou're working on. And you can also click the linkwithin documents have been uploaded to open in the relevantOffice online app. It could be that PowerPoint or Excel,OneNote or Word to work on the document collaboratively with yourcolleagues and that's what we see in a moment in in the demo.So let's see that in the live environment.So I could post an update to that external group that I created.Informing about a new document.So just saying ""Please add comments this new charterdocument.""And then I can decide to have them notifying so noticeit's defaulting to the team.I can also add individual people in there as well by clicking... clicking off the list as well.If I click on thepaperclip icon over here across the upload files,either files already been loaded into Yammer, upload afile from local computer, cycle them browse to document,selected document uploads : ""Company charter"" doc here.It gets loaded into the post and I could then postthat updates in that comment to my team.And then other members that team could then come in much thesame way.And then access the document.They can get click on""Download"" from here, they could add comments to that particularconversation thread.I could like it, they can share theconversation with other people either inanother person; posted another group or as a private message with someone.And they can do things like for view theconversation; stop following conversationsif you're already following it.And they can access the document itself, so they canclick on the document.Open up in Word online in this case, it's a Word document andthey're looking at it.We're on read only mode here.So just viewing it.They can download it, print it, download as PDF... They can alsoclick on the ""Go to file"" down in the bottom right.And from there, although getting better preview window, they canalso choose to edit the file.Won't show then open up that document in Word online,allowing him to start here working on that document, editing it.So one thing to notice here.It says documents saved to startto make changes to thatdocument.You see, this is saving very briefly then quickly saves it. So when you're working the online version of the documenthere in this Word document access from Yammer, you're updatingon the fly. So if you look at the file menu, we'll seethere's no save option as ""Save as""... There's no save optionbecause they're automatically saved this little reminder thattells you that.So you're saving documents on thefly as you work on them.So that also means I could also collaborate with other people onthis document as well.Let me just show you that in another demo.To switch to another machine for a moment.So for example, I could access this file here.This is a file stored in SharePoint light be.For example, it's a OneNote filelike and then open that up in a new tab or opening this...He's a one.So it used to this is I can open that document.And maybe I'm looking at it in sort of read only mode.This is a OneNote file. IfI click on edit and then I can get theoption over there, to use itin the full version of Microsoft.OneNote, or in the browser based version IE OneNote online.I'll select that option.So I can then start to add some text in here, there is ""User 2"".And if I switch across the other.Looking over here and then get..Yeah, they use to log in and access the same file.So it cames on read only mode, we can choose to edit in thebrowser again here.And as soon as I open that up, it says ""User 2""standard is also here like in the click on thatit says whereabouts they working if there's multiple pages orshow me which page.They're working on.Show me he's workingsomewhere on this page.And I'll see the changes that are they making to that documentas they work.If I switch back to the other useron the other page...You see that they also get the message that another user isworking somewhere on that page.You can choose the view authorsoption up here.Show authors to show which bits of contents mayhave been created by who and you will see the additional contentbeing added as you start to work on it in the online version.And as the page gets refresh, you'll see that content thatwe're adding beingadded to the page that I can have both seethat ""User 1"" and ""User 2"" content on the page.So you can havesort of real time collaboration.I guess it's respect the slides aren't it?So we've seen how we can use Yammer for allowing other peopleto sort of contribute and create documents, other documents, and byletting him co-author on documents.But for lock documents, you can also use it byasking people to participate.As well as sort of contributing co-authoring onthe document by ask him to perhaps add comments about thedocument as a conversation replying Yammer thread and youcan also create polls to obtain feedback on topics; oron documents; or projectsyou working on, related to yourteam or your project. So it's about quick look at that inthe demo.So I remember we uploaded that charter document America and askpeople to add comments on that new charterwe're doing. Createdthat in there and we post the update in MBS team groups. If we switch to the other user.And I remember his team, this is John Doe, the ""User 1"" dot standard.He can then reply to thatconversation, perhaps within additional information saying :""I think you needto change the intro or something?""So they can post comments that without makingchanges, the document.If you're not going to allow them to, ifyou've locked the document for editing.You could just askmembers of the team to make comments about the document andthings they would suggest changing on it or approving itor whatever. Or they could perhaps makes changes, downloada copy, make their own choices, and then upload those changes.So you can review the changes.They've made to their copy ofthe document that kind of thing and they can just post thatas a conversation. And gradually as people addmore and more replies that that thread of conversation ofcomments that builds up for that particular document,we've uploaded into the Yammer team group.Other people can also share that conversation again, sothey could share that to another group for example, nowthat all the company or a team and then say mentionedsomething at the conversation; sharing other people; they cansend as a private messages to someone, as well to have themreview that this comments or look at them and recommentthemselves for example.So every now switch back to the other user and then lookat the under any other it conversations.We can see that new comments.That's been added thereAgain, if we go to ""All conversations"" viewwe will see that in there as well.And when it is updated and who by and so on, you couldand then write a reply to that and say : ""OK thanks""into it, for example.And start to build up in a thread of conversation threadrelating to comments on that document, or that project you'reworking on for example.So you can also create polls to obtain feedback on topics ordocuments, or your team, or project.So I can click on pole here.Ask question in it.Cause this doc need more work and then I could provide a pole.And then I could send that to my team, or I could invite otherpeople individually to that, and then post that as a pole.Within switch back to the other user, you see a new update, so we'vejust seen the addition of thatconversation thread, saying ""OK thanks, I'll look into it"". Now,we got also this poll.that's appeared as an update. So wecan say  :""Does this doc need more work ?""We think it ""needsa small change"" for example, we can then vote on that.Change a vote if you want to as well, and then share that withsomeone else as well.So lots of tools we have been there forcollaboration, and participation, and co-authoring, within theYammer tool.Let's just go back to the slides.So the Yammer tool we've looked at briefly in this session can helpyou to improve communication, participation,collaboration withyour colleagues, or partners, or working online. Office 365 itselfprovides quick access to the Yammer app by the Office 365home page.Or the online start menu.You can use Yammer forcommunicating with coworkers and external partners within groupsor using the instantly with thechat tool.You can use Yammer to post updates about documentsor projects unityyou're working on, and then reviewreplies in that conversation thread relating to document or project.You can upload copies of relevant files in yourYammer post, so team members can view that document, comment onthem in the conversation thread. Also even open the links to thedocs, open work on them in the online version of theapplication and possibly also collaboratively in co-authoring mode.And lastly, you can use Yammer from your browser toparticipate by adding replies to commentconversation threads, orby responding to polls to get feedback from yourcoworkers, your colleagues, about a document or projectyou're working on at the moment.Now there are several post training resources available toyou to further enhance your MOOC training experience.You can review therecordings of previous webcast sessions, accessrelevant video tutorials, review the usage scenarios situationsand provide feedback on your experience. And there's alsoaccess to MOOC specific groups on Yammer for further information.And to extend your support of the MOOC environment.I'll just show you whatthat home pagelooks like on the MOOC portal foraccessing those webcast and training video resourceson this Office 365 live online training portal home page.So you can browse courses by use case,by products on the use case for things like ""communicate"",""share"", ""collaborate"", ""search"", ""produce""; products : ""messaging tools"",""collaborative tools"", ""Office productivity"", ""Social networking""...And then under ""Getting started""you gotta section for Office 2016, Outlook,Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and then Skype for Business and Sharepoint as well. And then when you find acourse you can click on it.The also progress currently on that courseyou can look under the course menu to seeresource is like when the next web conferencesessions are coming up.View recordings of the previous web cast.Review use case situation videos.And of course access for the tutorials for the products relatedto this course. In this case, things like Outlook and Skypeand Yammer for this particular course. And you can also accessthe group discussions linked to go and log into the Yammer Group, and...collaborate and participate, and participatediscussions with other people with a common thread in terms

Collaborative and storage tools,"Hello Welcome to the short training session on office make training. These sessions are related to specific products and tools and this particular. One is entitled Collaboration storage tools. My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this short session.So, in this session will introduce some specific Office 365 products that can be used to facilitate collaboration online storage will start by looking at the OneDrive app in Office 365 for cloud based online storage and then we'll discuss SharePoint sites in Office 365.The girls being to identify those Office 365 tools that can help to facilitate and simplify collaboration online storage. But if we look at these tools that have a quick introduction to the Office 365 environment.Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft. That gives organizations cloud based environment, not only for communicating with colleagues and working together collaboratively, but also for the storage of files and documents.Office 365 provides organizations with cloud based mail services through exchange online cloud based communication services through Skype for business online and cloud based websites through SharePoint online. The subscription also provides online versions of the office application. Sweet word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote.You can access your Office 365 subscription by navigating the web browser to portal dotoffice.com and this could be done for what kinds of devices such as PC's notebooks tablets and mobile devices, etc.And when you look at it takes you to your home page or learning page where you can either click in the top left corner. The icon on top left corner, which you often refer to the start menu. Online as a sort of launching pad for various applications or on the home page itself. You can click on different tiles available there to access the various services such as mail calendar OneDrive.And also the online office applications like word, and PowerPoint and so on.So let's take a look now that live online demo environment.So here we have an Office 365 subscription on the home page. Of this Office 365 tenant and we can see we got access to various styles hours to use various collaboration tools in office online.You can see here we got tiles for mail and calendar and people and also tools like Yammer, social networking tool. OneDrive share point sites and also we can see tiles for the online versions of the office applications such as word, and PowerPoint and Excel and so on in the top left corner have start button or I start menu on.Again, the access to all the various tiles available for the apps. We have and this is accessible from wherever we are in Office 365 not just smiling page. But from over. I can click on that button in the top left corner to access these applications. You can also modify this launch page. If you click on the 3 dots, which is the ellipsis button you can remove.Tiles from this app launcher. This start menu. Button you can pin them for example, and then pin something else, there instead so we click on view all my apps.We can select a different tile different applications. So perhaps the store. For example, we could then pin that there instead click on the ellipsis button choose Pinta app launcher.And then when we click in the top left corner will see that the store tiles now headed to start menu launcher instead.Will take Office 365 to get back to the landing page start page.From here, we can see you got access to notifications that pop up on here help menu and then we click on the cog and we can see we have settings. So we can do things like change the theme the look and feel of this environment.So we could do a lot of different options here for circuits and cats and robots and tiles and all sorts of things select brick.Theme save that and we can also do things like modify the start page. So if you want to start in your mail application. For example, rather on this home page. This default homepage. We can select that in the drop down list click on save and the next time we log in how it will be loaded up on to the mail application. Start there rather than this home lending page. You can also modify.Medication the change password and choose language and time zone settings, there as well. But that will be sufficient for the moment if you want to select your apps. You can have the second on this landing page or you can click on the apps in the tiles up here.Click on a tile to launch applications such as mail order then open your mailbox. You'll see that theme is available here and permeates through the product again. If I click on that. I'll again and choose Canada tireless time will see the calendar app. Open up in outlook.When again we can see that theme is there as well.And there's a calendar OK will switch back to the home page again.And then revert back to the slides.So we saw how we can access the portlet portal dotoffice.com. How can access the tiles on the landing page. Home page and also access all the tiles available via the top left corner button start menu. Online tracks sold our applications and services from there.Let's you wanna look at the first of the collaboration tools. We want to discuss in here.And this particular session, which is OneDrive.So you can use the online storage capabilities of OneDrive and Office 365 to access your documents for anywhere, anytime oversee from a different from multiple different device types and this makes working collaboratively much easier even when you're working remotely. So it's easy to do things like downloaded document to work with offline or you can work directly with it online.Caperatus coworkers and colleagues in real time, using real time collaboration tools and Co. Authoring tools within the office online applications.And when you select a document or right click on a document to access the menu for that item. There's lots of things you can do in terms of interacting with that document you can open it, either in the online version of the full version. You can share the document with other people. By using invitations more by supplying with a link to the document will see how to do that in a moment in the demo.As I mentioned collaborate document in real time, so I could show multiple people working on the same document and see information about the other people working in the document where they are what the name is in the ugliness. You can view and modify the permissions on a document download local copies of it, then you can also restore the version history and view the version history of older versions of.I will see all that information in the demo is just coming up shortly.So when you share documents with people are those people automatically notified if modifications made the document as well. So when you share it with other users they'll be made aware of changes once you make those changes to a document.So it's going to look at that in the live environment.So from our home page. You can either select OneDrive. From here, we can select the tile for OneDrive.In this case, I'm going to right click, it and choose open new tabs or so have a separate tab open with that on it. So we can see it's their title does OneDrive for business. This is the corporate version of OneDrive.And we could see who could list of documents and folders and so we can create new documents directly in this location. So I can create folders. I can create word Excel PowerPoint OneNote files directly in this location. I can upload files from my local computer as well, using that play button to add them into this on OneDrive cloud.And you'll see also have a sync button here that allows us to synchronise this OneDrive without other local.Folder on local computer so you can take files offline work on them and come back. Online again later on re synchronized to keep those versions in sync with each other.And to work with documents got a few options. You can either select the document radio button on the left hand side like so and then a menu appears at the top that let's you perform various actions on it like open that document in either the online version of the office suite or the full blown version, we can share the document get link to it.Really delete move copy except to rename and also look at version history. We have those same options available. When we right click on a document file right click on that document will see the same options available in this context menu and also get exactly the same options available when it click on the 3 dots. The ellipsis button. You can see the same options available there, so you can see that we can open as he said.Can share it so let's have a look at sharing it first in fact? What these are open a document in word online first so you can see that loading up mode online now.And one thing to straightaway working online version so it says appeared document 3 saved so as soon as I start to type in this document. You'll see that changes to say saving and then very quickly or change today saved again.Everytime make a sort of change that document or just say saving them very briefly and switch back to saved again. So you're saving documents automatically hence for farming. You'll see, there's no save option as a savers. But there's no save option because documents are saved on the fly as you work with them, using the online version.Stored files.So we can open it as I said there let's switch back to OneDrive you.We sorrow civic do things like download it and so on, but we can also share it so I click on share.I can share it with different people so I can share it by using an invitation here, so select user user 2 standards. Another demo account. I can choose whether they're allowed to have read only access to it using can view or they're allowed write permissions on it by choosing can edit I can add a message as well to send them as part of the invitation.Requirement to sign in rather than using accessing anonymously and I can send an email invitation to that user that let's them know that documents been shared with them. So when I click on share on that document be shared with that user.Just says that they are updating one items that's being shared now will see that changes from saying only you to see user 2 dot standards. That's now shared with someone else. If it says only you then basically the document isn't shared it's just you. That's able to see it locally only.The other way of sharing it and if I go back to click on share again is to share viral link. So I can use the link to share it with someone so rather than specifying a particular person inviting him specifically with invitation. I could just create a link so that could be a view link or an edit link and it could be one that requires sign in with the corporate account or one that doesn't say.Link with no sign in required for example, you can select that click on create then generates a link and that link can be copied somewhere so we could then select that right click, and copy it and then for example, paste into instant message chat window in Skype or into any message or something like that, and then post it off too.So they could access that link and then when they sit view that link they'll be able to access the document based on the privileges of signed in this case would be anonymous access. But we just view only so read only access in this particular case.So able to share it anyway with that with that user so if we switch over to.Another browser is the other user just minimize this slightly.So over here in a different browser have logged in as another user so on here. I'm locked in as user one DOT standard. Or she's actually John Doe.And in this other.Browser here, I'm locked in the user to the one that we just shared the document with a moment ago, so we can then open up OneDrive on this.Our subscription here's we click on file showed me this has happened to French menus. That's being used on a different demo. But we click on shared with me partager back. Mark and see documents that been shared with me that you're going to finish. That view to see the recent documents that been shared.And we should see our document 3 document. We just shared there. It is just been modified recently and shared by John Doe, which is high user one account.And I forget the Tower of the users already in that side that document and just edit. It modified it. So we can now also open it as a different user so I choose that on there and choose open with word online.You'll see a couple of things appear straight away, so in this in this mode in as user tube. He's been accessing as a share, I could decide whether I want to.Edit that document and argues editing word either full of version of word or can I do it in browser?Let me say it allows us to start editing the document and you'll see that as soon as I do that pops up, with a little notification here showing me that another user ID John Doe is currently working in the document shows me where he's working with this little flag and there's also a tip that pops up. In this power at the top to show me where he's working on it as well, and show me editing online similar if I then stop.Changes to this document and switch back to the other view will see that that user is also flagged as working in that section of the document and that their editing that document from there, so we see we got real time. Coauthoring and collaboration by virtual factory using online applications to access these online files stored in OneDrive.And that we can see with fresh but he was editing, it and we can see a flag that tells us where the writing it.OK, well, just close that document down in that browser switch back to the other view again.And go back to OneDrive and the last thing to see in here is the version history information. So if I going to click on the ellipsis or right click on it, and choose version history or access it from the menu. All the same thing that shows us our version history fact document so you can see who's been working on it. When how many versions. There are a lot of ideas the size change.Comment made on that particular change and we can also use these drop down lists in here to look at the previous version, so you can view that previous version, we can. Delete it and we can even restore back again. If you want to restore back. A previous version of that document rather than the current one, so that's version history, you can see within every document stored in here.Getting on the document type you select it's a word document your options open in word online or word whereas if you select a PowerPoint document your options change to choose to open in PowerPoint and PowerPoint online.I can switch back to the slides.So we saw how OneDrive can be used as a storage location. We can upload files. We can create new files in there. We can synchronize with the local directory on drive directional local computer and we can see which documents are shared with who we can share documents download them get copies of them look at version history and also work in real.Other authors multiple offers simultaneously on the same document.So the next time we ought to look at is SharePoint and SharePoint sites in Office 365.So we can use Internet sorbas sites in SharePoint as part of the Office. 365 subscription to allow us to work in teams storing and sharing files again. Co editing a document simultaneously sylvanas how we saw in OneDrive and they contain these sites contain these like document libraries and lists and.To work collaboratively online and also to get version history as we saw in OneDrive as well.Let's have a look at that in the live environment.So I'm use a slightly different Office. 365 subscription for this just got some content already in their sub sample sites so again I can access the SharePoint sites by clicking on the tile in here or I can use the start menu. Button appeared to click on share point again. I'll open up. But in new tab.I can see some sightseers about it to type the following all recent you sites. I'll click on the team site so you can see in here we got.Recently used sites frequently sites we can also add them to favourites up here by clicking on these buttons to follow them and then not be listed at the followed sites up here. So it's like that, once like that one. They'll be added to following list and then we can select them. From there, we can separate from the bar in here.So let's let the mbi S team site.You can see we got some documents already loaded into here, so a similar there will be stored in OneDrive, you get access to different tools up here. So you can create new documents into this document folder or library. You can upload files from your local machine to hear you can use this to sync with local copies stored on your local computer and then.Wow, you can access to the same sort capabilities of sharing files again using the invitations or links of actually going to share their you'll see that and if I recall more you'll see the same type of Dropdown. List the contact spend that we saw in OneDrive. Similar you can do the same thing by right clicking all document get the same menu and again by clicking on the 3.This button what's different with this one is it's laid out slightly differently, and you can also get a preview. So when you right click a document. You just get the standard menu here. When you click on the ellipsis button here in SharePoint sites. You get a preview of that document in this window. You can open the document. From here, you can share it. Follow it and also when you click on this ellipse button again, you get those same options.Click on the document down here, so again if I do something like share the document will see we get the similar options before invite people in here by entering their names.And then decide where they want to give them read write sort or edit rights as well.But they won't send any learn Invitational. Not so very is very similar. It's not quite the same dialog box are very similar to our box to what you see when you're working and sharing documents in OneDrive, so that's the one option, inviting people that way, and similarly we can also use the get link option to create links again. They can be anonymous or corporate links and they could be view already links.And as I said, before you can do the other stuff as well. You can open the document again. The same thing that would apply if we open this document in word online and work on it online. We can use real time. Coauthoring with other people simultaneously. We can get download local copies of far one again. We can also look at version history file.In much the same as before.And again, you options for viewing delete again, restoring that her version back again.Can I preview different on here for preview a slideshow again. You'll see that many view of that slide share presentation in the preview window. Let's actually move through the slides even in the preview window.OK so let's head back to the slides again.So much to say mostly sort of OneDrive, you can use these SharePoint sites as a collaboration tool, a collaboration environment for storage of files.To get access to other people shared files to share files with them upload files synchronized with local machine preview documents open them access them coauthor them and look at the version history.So these tools have briefly looked at in the session can help you to share and collaborate with your coworkers on documents. Both online and offline Office 365 itself gives you access to those applications by the landing page. Start page or online start menu.OneDrive provides that cloud based storage location for files. They could be shared with coworkers and we saw that from OneDrive, you can open documents in the full office version of the application or that the online version of the app. Both viewing Android editing purposes. That includes working in real time collaboration with colleagues on the same document simultaneously by using those Co authoring capabilities that we saw.We're working with online files stored in OneDrive or in a document library in SharePoint. We sort of moment ago and you can use SharePoint sites technique create team sites upload and share documents with your colleagues and again use that real time, Coauthoring to collaborate with colleagues on documents stored in SharePoint Document Libraries.Now there are several post training resource is available to you to fold enhance your mood train experience.

We will see all the applications, meaning I mean application. In fact, not ready to bust one applications application, but that you may found.In any application outlook Excel and word which is absent offices, so the objective for gain of these session to discover the big improvements in office, 2016, so let's start directly outlook where you will find.Some very interesting things so you probably know Luke.Cancel messaging service.And you probably know that in the interface you find the types that give access stop keep access to redone so too sure ribbon system, the most commonly used commands?And thePain here at on the left pane with all the photos here in the middle of the new stuff.Made a nuns right each time that you select made the complaint of the male penis in the reading pane the.What is new in outlook in outlook only few create email?But also the function is in fact, if you turn up to touch a file in outlook. The first you get is the recent items reached so these documents are the.Laugh or the most recent items have been accessed the last days. So here is the fastest course you can choose from. This list, remembers that the first possibility the second one is of course.Well, the people football happy new prototype brought this PC your eyebrows. The PC to look for them to attach game to this message, he knew also feature here is when you try to attach.But not locations and here you will accept all you wear locations related as you can see the OneDrive related to your company your organization your personal one quotes but that's my personal OneDrive.It's a science radiated to SharePoint, so you know that when you create a site in SharePoint. The dedicated storage spaces created also so you. You can find and attach a file coming from this spaces storage spaces and group.Would be speaking of groups of course, you can also there are dedicated space. So you can also attach a document from this group that the first possibility if you look at values decreased document. You may see that some are committing the cloud. Of course, this means that these documents is not in my.Please shut somewhere or at least the stored somewhere on the cloud. So if I select for example, you see this one is not the cloud. This one X so if I select this one from the cloud. The news feature so if you click the menu.Down menu in the document attachment you see that you can change permissions, so bad if it if you send this mate recipient. The recipient will be able to edit the document. If you select can view person will only be able to view the document so the difference is not attached.And the person will be able to view the document only in this case so that's the main new feature.If you see that the move attachment if you select retouch from web browser if you slipped.Document Pussy on my computer do count.Check the permission, my computer of course, there's no possibility to change permission, so that's a very important, and interesting feature being able to attach a document from replication and to change the permissions related to that.Document that the first feature great feature available from outlook and that we again have you in your in the way you shared so you don't be now to attach directly document and save it online and just send mail to the location.No and change the permission when needed, the second great, um change in outlook 2016 and I may stay in Office, 365 in the hold of Office 365 is the notion of fruit with.Briefly seen that could you seen that with the attachment but there is now an opportunity from outlook and also on the web. But here we are in office. 2016 here at the end of the home tab ribbon here to create a new group.As you say here in the popup could provides the play store share composition fight under group calendar so if you give name?Not seat.Mute.Pictures.Name of my group that I'm creating these are grouped in terms of server and see that all the things I've been removed and placed this name who ID is available. So I keep it now. It just says to select whether I want this group to be public or private I will select.And a select OK to create this new instantly create and you can now I can add people. Of course to this group.Here, I have added one, I can also add uhm.This person of course, orAnd at nose, depending on what's my needed to.Sorry.For example, and a silky.So now I have created my group just a few seconds. Not much and now the group is created by directly go Systemd Arctic sends me to it, you see. Now that in the folder.Pain there is a new folder called groups and if you take on more would get the whole you stuff. The groups your ass subscribed or you have created a new share you can see with cast new features, but the system when creating the.Group has already sent me too. You can say webcats new features so that's my my account and you can see. Now in the home tab into people that I am in the conversation. So I received an error telling me that the group has been created awesome.And remember it's off visit the same. Welcome to the web cast at this group that hold the members are received now if you click on calendar in the ribbon that check your calendar so that the group can tentatively cookware as we be able as much as I.With my own outlook my own account. So here I'm able to create a new appointment or a new meeting request for the whole group to define select a new phone on for example, and see the hope the whole sorry I added to do the.Of course I've got all sorts of scheduling assistant where all the functions.Officer outlook are available, so receive them uhm. I am in the calendar if I go back to their.And go to the groups.I have features.Um, I'm here so I have to calendar. I've got also the files. Both eyes water when they are fine. In fact, it's a place.On the web online SharePoint can see your share point so the SharePoint Server of.On the web where the file has been created space has been created the boat documents just a few seconds to be able to see the space that has been created search space so even entered my group now you see.Home.I'm on SharePoint so document is dedicated to enterprise upload to upload files from my computer and share them with all members mucousy forms.So conversations message can send getting the 5 and even a notebook you can you know know book is the word create quick notes and a chain they would be all shared with?The group, so their interest here 61 not only group as we know them just at least you should least just send mail group of people of members. Now it's really, really something much more interesting in terms of collaboration because.All members of the group will be able to share a conversation things important documents files share then corrects even not members of the group or even outside the company and the notebook to create space on the OneNote.The group will be able to ship so very, very interesting feature here in available for cook, but of course, it seems dazed. It's related to the pipes related will fish 365, so that the Second Main.Picture.In a creation of group then the last feature available is something called to let them so trust. What is so they can see the folder pane sets and move forward and it was based on an outlook?Able toDecide, which makes our miss that you are receiving are of low priority so depending on what are your actions we have 3 new messages the system with Apple 2?Folder documents that are supposed to be of low priority for you and of course, you can help this outlook decide by terror when you receive a message to him.Directly put it in Clutter folder under stem will soon understand that either the center on the subject of the mail. On this kind of thing are considered low priority and should be able to automatically send document directly in these places folder where you.That's it the the messages are of course again. If you there is a document that is here and it has inspired error so and say you just by getting it out and put it back into the inbox. This is to Inwood understand that these kind of messages.If not high priority I am more important that outlook at thought at first so these are the new features in outlook. And here again on the file system on the web can see either through documents of these documents now show.The group, so.Second, possibility, the news in outlook that are open outlook. The first change in our cook by the changes that outlook are mainly mainly based on new charts and maps so the very first one, is new one which is based on.Maps now when you create a table based on geographical data, meaning continent countries counties regions Postal code. The system is able to get'em in that you are dealing with geographical.Region and when you go to the insert tab. You know that the again. Then then you are the tax in Office, 2016, which is nothing new so the ribbon here. You've got recommended charge so you have caught the recommended chance, but goat.Is something cool not?And now you can slipped and that and you see that the system has been with chief all the first continent, but the countries to our GIS here China Canada, the us of course president.Speech the chart as usually you can have and you can of course. For example, ask for data labels that change the region and changed the style of course game.You are at the disposal everything that was available or is available with different charts. But these new so now you can completely have much.Better way to show your table into.Map world map are only just figures the data where only for Europe on Europe could be displayed if it's on the Mary calf calls America only. Display the system is able to determine from which region that will work, the data come from and to adapt and cream.Accordingly, that the first possibility to stick and one is something called hierarchical chart if again. We go to insert and request recommended charts. So here again list of recommended chart based on what the system excel things should be correct for your.Display off your data but if you go get into old chart. We found at the end, something you scold Sunburst and if you select Sunburst. You see that this is a new kind of chart, which this time is based on hierarchical.Data so this is totally new was not available in the password. Of course again. The same features you can change the design of the charts, OK, but and of course, OK, you can decide let me change into the gym charge title well. Everything is available to you as much as.You are the charge, but this one last one available is when you have that use the system is now able to determine.Um 3, so that you don't you don't go to insert but you could data and data at the end of the ribbon you find something called forecast sheets and now you can get a forecast complete forecast for your figures values so here.Nice forecast if I.Select today with you now you see that there is 3 figure. The first one, and the table has been increased and with new values added which are the forecast based on your first value and you have not 3 possibilities. The very first kiss when you the upper.Don't point, meaning that that space on the US. Most confidence and the figures and you think that based on where the past values. The system seems that if we consider the best possibility that would be the point of the upper confidence bound here, the lower confidence.The value is inserted in this exception here and of course to the forecast for based on the values provided so these again than you.And you a new charger. It's not directing insert tab as it normal chart. But it's the forecast sheets and not only the chart. It still so sheet where the system has been able to collate forecast genius, so if now you select a point to see that the.Changing and step through the date and of course, but you act like you can change when you create you can give options to have different options. Display in table and in the charge itself.That where the news inside of from Excel the last.News in Excel is something completely new is the possibility for you to record.To record sorry an what's going on. On screen for that. You don't go to search oh, but you go to the insert tab where of course, you can research. Lots of things that you probably knew pictures online features. It's attracted many things where I already added.And improvements of of PowerPoint, but this time at the end, you put something a group of actions called media where you would be able to research videos. First um would you record audio you can record what I'm saying here for exam?Um.So it's recorded twice in fact, one for the webcast and one for the one for the PowerPoint so I said, OK, and here you see. Now that there is a newer and you added icon with and and and you can hear press the sound so again you can record sound.The third possibility, which is also available. You can say you have the possibility to record what's on screen so you just save it. For example, that you want to record everything that is going on. These days and and in 3 seconds, the system will Rick.Then sing.And, of course was going on on screen so that's each remove.In link at this cancel and so now by Chris.I stop the recording and if I go back to.Night.Document I have now works as being green on screen so recorded and again played back here play impose web so video that you can include Tabrizi into a PowerPoint and that's a video coming from the recorded.Uhm screen so you can now record your screen, and insert it directly into you PowerPoint.That was the.Main knew in.PowerPoint.So now let's have a look to the changes that I've been the black by Microsoft on all.The applications of office of nearly all of them. The main characteristic got back here is that now. You can of course share you don't. But you can collaborate with other.On these documents and not only can you share this document collaborate of course on the?One by one faces, but also you can or you can.Share it.With other person said, but also you can edit a document at the same time.So.I want to share this document with.Someone.And for sure.To Britain would be able to?Cause received a message here.And the person able to correct.Thanks document is course online when you kick the shared document is suppose either. That meant already another. The system will ask you too.Save it online and once saved the person would be able to Todds presentation, but Eddie presentation online and you can cook edit document?I think that.So if I say.The system is updating.Goodnight.Person would be able to.Work at the same time.Open.And you see it in here now, meaning my.The person who is able to work on the instrument. You can see here that I am also working on this document in the right upper part says that's the person I've shared with here is trainer. One also modify the document with me that at the same time now.25 here I am on my computer and you can say that the other person is working and the other person is saying that I'm posting working so we can now work.Get up and of course I can even.Change and if and when are and you see I have had it recent? List audio and you can see that also my colleague? Is able to see the changes. So here process. It stage and in a few months. I have also process exchange.Separately, we can cool edit say document with no problem. Just a question of of sharing documents and waiting a few seconds. Caesar changes because of the Internet connections and and the server settings, but you can see that really maybe we can at the.On the same document and instantly or nearly instantly the the changes are taken into account back. The system and at anytime. I can see who's connected because I asked here you see here it says that the other.If you think flight 2.And I can see it so text free the way true.Anne to share documents, but also to work together on the same document related to that there is a new feature when you have shared the document. Here, there is new, I can related to the activity if you click there, you get the complete history.3 of the activities that have appeared on this document so you can say China once at the file. There's an open version, etc, etc. And if you select the Patch recursion, you can.Restart the best version is also contacting the server for information and you will be even able to restore a past version, so very, very important, and new collaborating you see here security warning references to external media.OK, so I can enable the contact, but just before below. Previous version to make this press previous version become the latest version 3 storage effectively store would be the next new version and online because it's unknown. All versions averages did at anytime you can reverse tour another.So if you don't need that just close until my next last version and if I go to my colleagues. You can see that the S that have uh that realization has been added also so it's a question of a few M seconds. One minute, depending gain on the Internet connection.It's very, very, very important feature of Office 365 and Office 2016 because now you can work online and at the same time on and on a computer with the Office 2016 version installed and at the same time you can work together on the document.One of the most version that you can unfix available.This is available on all.On all.Documents because if I go to Excel I have also this share.Uh button and here I have the activity to see the activities also so if I click on share and share also this document with my click that what we have seen with PowerPoint is also available out there and if you go to.Work amount which is not.It's exactly the same show you nevertheless I would do that.If you open the document.Thank you just shoot that, the same.Uh the same.Is available?Here, I have to share and then you have the activity available also so I can share this document and again work at the same time on the same document other from a computer or online depending on what's my need the next possibility feature that is shared between all the applications.Open word it's something which is called? Tell me what you want to do where to avoid being lost among all websites. You just have to put soup to put something that you want to do if you step forward.Uh.It end up with office macros, so each time yet. For example, my quivers. I get up on my cruise. Mistype creator and micro enable disable macros. So I have instantly and you can even have something which is also new and shared with old documents and applications.So here the tell me what she wants to do is really you just enter words. The system will you see for example, directed you microsc so it's able to directly send you to the function itself and create macro given name, and create a macro if you know how to create.So that's available in all.The applications so here I have also can you want to do and speaking up the smart? Look up that's also new and available in old documents if you're rightly camp in outlook. Also, it's available, but it would be much more difficult to.If you are at risk.Nope, and you have smart look it. So you have word Excel PowerPoint. You have got this function also solar system is able to give me the definition of open the noun it's powered by its letter to being so but.Wikipedia, the Golden Basket Santa Maria Web search and see that exploded by being so these are the new features that are available in all applications to tell me again, you can see it. Tell me what you want to do, um available.In the full applications main applications and the smart who kept so where you can just rajic on any words, I say the system is able to retrieve information Smart Web from the web.That's where than you.Features available in.Office 2016.

What's new in Outlook 2016,"Welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training.2This session is part of a bigger topic called “Get Started with Office”.3On this particular topic, we have chosen to show you today what's new in Outlook 2016.4Welcome to this session.5My name is Charles Bonachera6and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together.7What will we be discovering during this period?8Here is the plan.9First, we will discover one of the main new features of Office10because it's now available in the Office applications:11the “Tell me what you want to do” field.12I will show you how you can use this to question Outlook in particular.13Then we will see another new feature which is the Meeting Poll Reply.14Then another one, which is using the @ in the body of a message15to call the attention of someone16and to add its name to the recipients.17The last thing we will see is how you can keep the Outlook add-ins open.18In the past, you could not keep them open as you were working with the Outlook add-ins19or you were working with Outlook, now you can keep your add-ins open while working with Outlook.20The objective of this session is to discover some of the new features that will help you work faster and easier.21Let’s go directly in Outlook.22Here is Outlook.23You know Outlook with all the messages that have arrived.24In the past, when you needed help from Outlook or any other Office applications,25you used to go to ""Help"".26Now there is something much more user-friendly, which is close to what you could get from Cortana in Windows 10.27This field is at the end of the tabs list.28You will get something called “Tell me what you want to do”.29There, you just need to put something.30For example, if you write ""add-in""31you will get a few already prepared answers.32At the bottom you get help on add-ins.33If you select ""get an Office add-in for Outlook"" for example,34to learn how to get an Office add-in in Outlook,35by selecting this option, at the far right of your screen36a new help window will appear to show you how to get an Office add in for Outlook.37You may even find small videos which show you in practice how to perform what you asked  this field ""Tell me what you want to do"".38It's very powerful and useful.39If you select another word, for example ""increase""40you see ""get help on increase"":41""Change the font or font size in the message list"".42The system will propose you something related to the topic that you are looking for:43""Increase"".44If you select ""Change the font...""45on the far right you get a new help window46that will show you how to increase the font,47the size of the font48for sent or received emails.49This is the first feature which is very helpful and useful50that I used many times: ""Tell me what you want to do"".51It works contextually and a bit like Cortana52trying to extract from the words you used what you need exactly53and what you want to find.54Sometimes even when it is a function,55I'm thinking of the other Office applications56which also provide this field,57directly create the functionality you are looking for.58Remember: ""Tell me what you want to do"" when something you don't know how to perform, ask Outlook with this field59and it will tell you exactly how to do this.60This is the first feature.61Another new feature which is quite useful in Outlook62is the Meeting Poll Reply.63What is it?64I will close the search.65When you get a message from someone66For example, I received a message with 3 attachments67but that's not the point here.68You may want to propose to discuss the topic of this message,69to propose a meeting.70Instead of going directly in the calendar to find a place to meet and send an invitation71there is something much easier proposed in Outlook 201672which is called ""Reply with Meeting Poll"".73In the Home tab, at the end of the ribbon,74you will find at the very far right75something called ""Reply with Meeting Poll"".76It will look for you and try to propose a meeting to the sender.77Here you can change the duration of the meeting you are going to propose.78You ask for just work hours.79You can change the time zone.80There you see all the proposed timings for you and the sender of the email81to whom you want to send a time for a meeting.82If you select a time83you select it, click on ""Next""84and you see the selected times.85You can change the meeting settings.86Here notifications are off.87If you say ""Insert to email""88the system will create a new email89with the proposed time: ""You are invited to a meeting""90and you can now send this invitation91that will be an answer to the email you received from your sender.92By sending, the system will send this direct invitation to the sender93who then becomes recipient94and who will be able to select an option to accept or reject the meeting.95You can change and insert to the email that has been sent.96You can even have an online meeting with Skype,97which is an application included in Office 365.98This is completely new feature in Outlook 201699which is to answer by a request of meeting100directly in the email received.101That's the second opportunity, new feature in Outlook 2016.102Another one is that in the past, when you were using the add-ins in Outlook 2016,103the only available possibility was to either work within the add-in104or to work in Outlook.105So going back to Outlook would close the add-in.106Now you have the opportunity to keep the add-in open.107The add-ins are available in the Home tab,108at the far right of the ribbon109where we found ""Reply with Meeting Poll"".110Here is an add-in111""Customer Manager""112which is very used professionally to keep customer management efficient.113Here I have my add-in open114with many things that I can perform with this add-in.115I have selected the email from my sender,116I have created a contact in my customer manager add-in.117In the past, to get back to Outlook118I would have closed the add-in, just as I have done now119but in 2016, you can pin this add-in.120In this case you can now go to Outlook to create new emails121and you still have Outlook available on the right122and the add-in to create a new contact for example,123from the email that I have selected in my list of messages received in the past.124Now there is the opportunity to pin the add-ins directly and keep them open even when you're working with Outlook.125The next and last feature which is available126is a little bit different.127When you create a new email128you have the opportunity, many times used,129but with nothing concrete and practical to be found in emails in Outlook.130In the body of a message,131you can write anything132but you want to catch the attention of someone.133For that, add the @.134Just by typing @ in our message,135the system will automatically propose a list of people.136Of course, if you continue writing and typing a name or something137you can see that the list of people has adapted138and now you can select someone.139We can see that in the body of the message140the name has been added directly141but also in the recipients field142the name has been added.143Here if you can even remove part of the name144and you can continue to write down your message, etc.145It's very interesting to have this new opportunity.146Each time you write,147you can148write something directly in the body of your email.149Give instructions for example, to someone as you write your message150and at the same time, the people that you are writing to151have their names directly added to the recipients names.152This is a new feature in Outlook 2016153that may help you in working faster and easier154each day of the week.155In Office generally speaking, and specifically in Outlook156has a purpose to help you work better, faster, quicker and easier.157That was the use of some new features in Outlook 2016.158Thank you for attending this session.159I hope you will make the best use of it.160Don't forget to look for other Office 365 training sessions regarding Office.161Thank you.

Outlook 2016 - Discover the calendar and tasks,"Welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training, which is part of the scheme ""Get started with office"". We will during the next few minutes discover the calendar and tasks in outlook so welcome again to this session. My name is Shepered, and we are going to spend the next.30-45 minutes together. Let's see the plan, the agenda what we're going to do during these few minutes first. 1st, we will discover the calendar and we will see how to create appointments.We will see how to create meetings and also recurring meetings.Then, at the end, we'll discover how to create a task and how to asign a task to another person but let's start from the beginning ; for that let's go to outlook here is outlook. Here is Outlook that you may know and here we are in the mailbox.Our mailbox general :I use it from there, you know how to get toCalendar at the left button part of the screen, you find'll a few icons. This one is selected because we are in the mailbox, then just here we can find the calendar icon which giveus acces to the calendar.Calendar, which is shown here.In the group of ""My calendars"" because as you can see here you may have several calendars available from this calendar. Part of outlook. If you have several accounts different accounts in outlook configured added.And you will have course, one calendar for each account that has been added to Outlook. So here I am in a calendar. You recognize of course on the left the folder panel individual view panel and up.in the window, you recognize your ribbon, which will give you access to a part of group of actions called ""New"" where you will be able to create a new appointment.Here we have a pop up window.Asking newe requesting information on the subject of the appointment.I'm meeting with human resource manager, I will give the location if I go at the end of the list I will find the previous location that I have used in my calendar, OK, so for example, here again at HRM's office.Which I will select and then youCan select the date for example, the 25th of January and the time.For example, from 10AMto 11 AMOK, so that'sMy appointment and if if this were a whole day event I can check the box ""All day event"" and in this case I know that my event there is no time range available now because it's considered starting at the biginning of the day and ending at the end of the day OK.If now I go to ""Save& Close""? I have my meetings. The uper part of the day of Wednesday out of the time range out of the timeline because again it is considered the whole day event. If I need to change thisicon, you double click to open it again and Check ""all day event"" and I find again. My time range from 10:00 to 11:00 that I can change if I want.Now this time rangethat we saved here and now I have my meeting on Wednesday from 10 to 11 and if I let my cursor over the item. I can see a little bit more detail with the Start and end time.And I can see the location and the reminder 1 hour. From there, I can just drag in the item. I can increase the time or of course, decrease the time range of my appointment, OK If I need again to change something or to edit the item. I just need to double click and here it is and I can again change the time for example, or if I need to i can create an occurrencethat'll repeat regularly so I have the possibility to put a starting time and ending time, the duration (1 hour) and then the recurrence current button, which can be daily, weekly, monthly.OK and if it is monthly or weekly. I can enter the number of the recurrence. If the recurrence is each week, or every 2 weeks whatever.Select the day of your parents of the occurrence OK and I can select the range of recurrence with no ending date by default.But I can say that there will be an end after just 5 occurrences or just select date for the ending and saying for example, that it will be the last day will be on Wednesday, the 21st of May 2017.If I click on OK and save and close the experience I can say here. The little icon that shows me that it is a recurrent item if I click to next week,  Nothing appears because it only occurs every 2 weeks. But if I go to next one proceeds to the 12 of february.I can find my meeting again with the human resource manager.on Wednesday, the 8th with the same timing because I have set the same time being, one hour.I get back to this week.So you can again if you double click on an recurring item. The system will ask you if you prefer to open just this one. This occurrence because you want to change just this one because for example, the human resources prefer to change the timing.11:00 to 12:00 save and close only these occurrence will be.impacted by this change and if I go to 2 weeks again my meeting is from.10:30 to 11:30, so you can select one occurrence and change it or if you prefer open the recurrence.And there is a button here. Edit series that you have. You change but this time for all series that will be impacted by you changesSo again double Change one occurrence or all the occurrences of these appointment.And, of course, if youYou can right click, and you have several possibilities never forget the right click, which is contextual. In fact and depending on where you perform this right click will get new menu that will give you a new opportunities to change.to edit.or to manage an item here for example again open occurrence or open the series I can have a quick print I can forward it to someone else.... don't forget the right click, which is very, very helpful, even more if you are a little bit lost in a new environment.So that's the way to create an appointment. So the appointment I remind you is just the indication that there is an event occurring to you, even if it's to someone else but only you is directly.Don't need to inform anybody else, because the other part is probably already aware of this appointment, so there is no need to send anything any invitation and information. Just you and that's all . Now there is another possibility to create in your calendar, which are.The Meeting :  the difference between a meeting and the appointment is that for a meeting, you have to invite to schedule a meeting (probably in the room)at least.Or anywhere, you have to inform and invite people to reunite to meet in a specific place together to discuss a subject specific material subject. Please note that just that, if you work on an appointmentOK.And if you click on ""invite attendees"" This appointment, will instantly change into a meeting or a meeting request.Otherwise, if you need for example, to create the meeting or schedule a meeting on Friday from 10 to 11 either You right click on this time range and select ""new meeting request"" or you select the time range and go to the ribbon.Then in the new option grouping you find new meeting you see this icon that indicates that all that people will be inducted by this meeting. So you click herethat will again request some information from you regarding this new request meeting request.So again we find the subject location start and end time, we can specify if it's an ""all day event"" even from there and you can select a start time again and an end time. The new thing is that there is a button 2 because this is an invitation.Sent to some colleagues probably, several colleagues that will gather a email requesting from them to decide whether they will assist or not, to be accept or reject the meeting or whatever the reason is.InThe global address list remind that if there is several accounts You have to select the relevant one or the people to be invited so here for example. I've got4 names the corresponding tothis name, so I can invite them.Now You haven't sent this meeting invitation no, but it is an invitation the subject.For example, ""Training reports"" and the location again, I can select from the past ones. Previous ones, or I have even here as it a meeting I will probably or the system supposes assumes that I will have we need.a meeting room so I have here the button rooms to select from the rooms.OK, the one that will be needed for my meeting.So now I have planned a meeting on Friday from 10:00 to 10:30 (grabs 30 minutes. I will get one hour) but from there It's impossible for me to know who is available and who's not ; Perhaps Sylvestreis available but perhaps not the other colleague? Perhaps the room itself is not available for that there is a function:In Outlook, which is called the ""scheduling assistant"".That will instantly give me access to the availability of all attendees and let me know if the time range is available for a meeting for all of us or if someone cannot be reached or is not available.During this time range. If I look at myWindowI can see that on Friday from 10:00 to 11:00 apparently everybody is available. On the contrary If I look at the previous date here, which is Thursday from 2pm to 3pm. I can see that at least 3 of my colleague, my attendees are (and I can see it at the bottom).They give meaning that it's not sure that they can be available for a meeting. So I can adapt my time range . For example, on Thursday, it could be relevant to have a meeting from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM becauseEveryone is available.So I can change my mind, and put it previously. If this roomWhere already booked by someone else, the same thing will occur I will see the room as being not available for this down range and I could also change the room for exampleOr try to find another date for this meeting again . for this meeting you could add here new persons.if you re click I can say yes, I need Pierre Skolil, OK and we see that here there is a meeting already booked from 2pm to 3pm by this attendee of course, as much as I did for the appointment.create the recurrence for this meeting for example, every 2 weeks againon thursday why not? I could decide to have no end date or just to say that it will end after 5 occurrences.And in this case again in my calendar this meeting will appear every 2 weeks until the date and the deadline is reached.Again I could change.the time here, again, I could add attendees here to have direct access to my global address list of my company or my organization, I could add rooms from hereSelect another one like one, here I can have several options. ""Show my only my working hours""  or many other things, and of course,If I go to ""Appointment"" instead of ""Scheduling Assistant"" I could even insert,And attach a filefor example, from this PC, or from this Recent documents.Or even my locations to find documents from groups or other application  for example, one drives or share point or siteor from other side, so I could even attach a file from the web.So now we can save it if I don't want to send it now and now here I have my occurrence. The next week, Nothing the next one,  Yes, because it's every 2 weeks now, I have myoccurrence if I double click on an occurrence they will ask me if I want to modify or change just this one of the enterprise series as much as I did put the appointment nothing new here, I can.Increase the time here for this occurrence without.Changing anything in the next level.And that's how I can creates both an appointment or a meeting. The difference again being that for a meeting you will invite or request schedule people to answer reply to your request of a meeting.That's how you can very easily create appointments and meeting. Now let's have a look to the last things that was planned for this session. The creation of tasks, which is  even easier. I mean than creating appointments for a meeting.But you have at the left bottom part of the screen this icon ""task"" where if you over this icon you can see all pending tasks, if you click on tasksyou get to the module where you will be easily create with the right click, When you task request for someone else or again in the ribbon on the left part of the ribbon in the new grouping""New task"" and again, you will very easily type a subject.The possibility to define the start date for this task , let say on Wednesday and you know you say that it's 2 in 2 days. I have a due date?27th Friday, so this star dates should begin on Wednesday andbe complete on Friday.I can have a reminder search again, change the ring-tone I want, and I will be reminded.At 8:30 on Friday that there is a task pending, that today is not started because it's not created yet you can change the priority into ""High"" and we see that here the completeness of the task is zero again  hasn't been createdThe owner it's myself, so this task is assigned to me. If you  ""save and close"" you have a task here because I have requested the next 7 days. If I click on today have no task for today.

Outlook 2016 - share and collaborate quickly,"Welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training.2During this training, we will discover and discuss how to share and collaborate quickly with Outlook.3Welcome to this training.4My name is Charles Bonachera5and we are going to spend the next 45 minutes together.6The plan of this session:7We will discover how to view and use several calendars from Outlook,8your calendar and several others if you decide to see and use them.9We will also see and discover how to share your own calendar10easily, internally or externally.11By internally, I mean inside the organization.12By externally, I mean with anybody.13Of course, there are big differences between both kinds of sharing.14Then we'll see how you can delegate your calendar to someone.15For that, we will see how you can manage the access permissions to your calendar.16That's the objective: discover mainly these features which are in Outlook and in the calendar part of Outlook.17Let's start from the beginning.18For that, let's go to Outlook.19From your web mail, you all know how to access your web mail,20Here, I have access to Outlook and to go to the calendar21and to share and delegate your calendar,22you can easily go to the calendar.23At the left-bottom part of your screen,24there are several icons25that you can select26to go in the functions of Outlook.27Here for example, to the calendar.28In the Folder pane of the calendar,29you will find your calendar or calendars.30Here, as I have, you have different accounts configured in Outlook31because each time you configure a new Webmail, a new account in Outlook,32the corresponding calendar will appear in this list.33I have 4 accounts.34It means that normally, in the list, all the calendars appear35and I just have to check one box regarding my account36to see the calendar of this account,37to display the account38and check if I don't need this account.39In the View pane,40I can deselect or close a calendar.41In my calendars, we will first see how you can easily add new calendars.42For that, in the Folder pane,43select ""My Calendars"" in this group of calendars44""My Calendars"".45If you right-click,46you get a function, an option to add calendars47and you will be able, very easily, to add from your calendar.48Be careful in case you have several accounts,49several mailboxes configured in Outlook,50to select the one that is relevant in terms of person,51to select the address list of the organization where the person that you are looking for is,52the right organization.53In the field, you just need to enter the name of the person54that you are looking for.55I found it.56I click on the calendar to add it to my list.57I can see that in my list of calendars, Philippe Houyau has been added58and on the right part of my reading pane59I have now the calendar of my colleague.60By default, I can see his availability61in a few words:62Free, Tentative and Busy.63In case the time period is busy, it means that he is not available.64So it's very easy.65Each time you right-click on My Calendars, you can add a new calendar from any address book66and if you have many accounts,67you just have to select the correct one68and the system will give you access to the person69whose calendar will be added to your list.70In terms of view of these calendars,71we can see that my calendar on the left is in one color.72The other one is in another color73and they are side by side.74There is an option to overlay75if you right-click on any calendar and select ""Overlay"",76they will be overlaid.77Here I have the calendars together.78The different colors will show me the availability of both my colleagues and I79so that I can, for example, select the proper time for a meeting.80here for example, on Thursday from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock, I could have a meeting with my colleague81or from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock.82Also I could schedule a meeting with my colleague.83When you are finished, there is an arrow in the tab of my colleague84where you can decide to view side-by-side85to go back to the side-by-side view of the calendar.86So you can easily add a calendar from any person of your organization87or at least from the global address list of the different organizations88on the different accounts that you may have in Outlook.89So that's the way to easily add new calendars.90You have a large list of calendars91and by checking them you can easily add new calendars.92You can overlay them to have them together93and, with the colors, see which time is available for a meeting.94The new option is to add calendars from your colleagues in your own calendar.95That's a way to add calendars from people in your organization.96Now we will discuss and see the way to share your calendar with someone inside or outside your organization.97For that, select your calendar, right-click,98and at the bottom of the menu, you find ""Share"".99Don't forget the right-click which gives you access to a lot of actions wherever you are in Office 365.100It's very helpful.101In Share, you have 2 possibilities.102We will first discover the first one, which is ""Share Calendar""103the normal sharing, I would say,104which is a real sharing which in fact is an email105that you can send to someone inside your organization.106Be careful to select the right one.107Here, for example.108In this email with a predefined subject,109""Sharing invitation Trainer"",110you will send the possibility to the recipient here,111one of my colleagues,112to see the details of your calendar.113Here for example, by default my colleague will only see my availability:114available, tentative or busy.115if I select ""Limited details"",116my colleague will be able to see some more details added to the information, the availability.117And ""Full details"" will display all the information displayed in my calendar118in terms of availability, place119in terms of content of the meeting or appointment, etc.120In the same email,121you may request the recipient to also share his or her calendar with you.122Check ""Request permission to view recipient's calendar""123for that and in this case, they will give you permission to see also their calendar.124There is also a mail, so you may leave a message to your colleague.125And if you send the email,126you will give full details access to your calendar to your colleague in this case.127This way, they will be able to see all the complete details of your whole calendar.128That's the way to share your calendar internally, inside your own organization.129I don't save130and I will show you how to do the same with someone external to your organization.131A person which is external to your organization, by definition, will not get access to your mailbox nor to your calendar132because there is no relationship between another person and your organization if the permissions are not given and by default they are not.133So what you can do to share your calendar134is a kind of sharing which is not the same category.135If you right-click and select Share,136 you get ""E-mail Calendar""137and in this case there is another pop-up like what happened before.138Now there is a pop-up where you will decide which calendar among the one(s) in your own calendar139which one(s) you want to share.140You will select a date range:141will you share today only?142just tomorrow?143the next 7 days?144the next 30 days?145the whole calendar?146(meaning from now until the end of your of time)147Or specified dates, for example from the 23rd, today, to the 23rd of February.148Then, you also need to decide which kind of details you are going to share with this external person:149Availability only (free, busy or tentative,150working elsewhere or out of office).151That's related to your calendar.152Limited details (availability and subjects of calendar items only).153Or Full details (availability and full details of calendar items),154everything which is in your calendar will be also showed and seen by the external person155that will receive this email because it's an email.156If you select Advanced, you can also include in your calendar private marked items.157In this case the recipients will be able to see the full details of your calendar.158You decide when you want to share: daily schedule or a list of events.159Let's have ""Daily schedule""160because it's visually more interesting.161I click on OK.162Instead of giving access your calendar, which is not possible because the recipient is external to your organization,163in this email, the content of your email appears164which is directly copied in  the body of the email itself,165so it's kind of a screenshot of your calendar,166that you can now send to anybody outside your organization.167It's not a way to share your calendar since it's not possible with someone external168but a way to nevertheless send your calendar169for example, to decide with this recipient together for a time range for a meeting or an appointment.170Send the email171and the recipient will get an exact view of when you are available or not.172That is the way to share your calendar with someone externally173which is quite helpful in certain cases to decide on a time range for a meeting.174Here we have seen and discussed the way to share calendars.175Now we will see how you can delegate you calendar to someone.176We will start inside your organization.177For this, you have to be in the calendar part of Outlook178and from your calendar, in the ribbon,179in the Home tab,180you have Calendar Permissions.181By clicking on the Calendar Permissions,182you will get access to the full details of the permissions regarding the calendar.183You can see that, by default, the selection is put on ""Permission Level: Free/Busy time""184meaning that anybody in your organization can see that you are free or busy.185That's by default.186Anybody in your organization can see if you are free or busy187but you can change this permission for all users in your organization,188which is not recommended.189You can give free/busy time.190What you can do, it's a possibility which may be very helpful for a group of people191or if you want someone to be able to take your own mailbox and manage it192you can find an email address and add someone193and give more permissions than the default ones.194Here for example, your colleague will see the free/busy times, but also the subject and the location of your meetings.195That's in terms of reading.196If you want your colleague to be able to write something in your calendar,197you may decide what they will be able to write.198For example, to create items,199to create subfolders,200to edit own201and edit all.202Edit own to edit their own added items.203Edit all so they will be able to edit anything that is in your calendar.204So be very careful with that.205If you select ""Full details"" in ""Read"",206they will see full details.207Write: they will be able in this case, for example, to create subfolders but not items.208In this subfolder, it is the same for the delete section: by default there is no possibility to delete an item,209but you can decide to give them the possibility to delete their own items210or all items if you prefer.211By clicking on OK, it gives this person the possibility to manage your own calendar with different permissions212with other permissions than those which are by default given by the system.213which is to see only the free/busy time.",welcom offic 365 mooc training2dur train

Excel 2016 - Quickly enhance your results,"Hello and welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training.2The topic of this session will be to see how to quickly enhance your results in an Excel worksheet.3Welcome to this session my name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together.4The plan: What are we going to see during this little time range?5We will see the concept of tables and specifically the automatic formatting.6Then we will see the conditional formatting and how it can help to enhance your tables.7Then we will see how to insert and customize sparklines,8which is something new in Office 2016.9Finally, we will see how to create and customize charts.10Let's go to Excel.11I created a table.12And let's see how we can customize this table.13First, we are in the table and you have to be in the table before formatting.14In the upper part of the screen, you know that now for sure,15what is called the ribbon,16which changes depending on where you are and which tab you select in the list of tabs.17Here in the home tab,18with the ribbon corresponding to the home tab,19we can find here ""Format as Table"".20Here appears different types of tables21for the format.22You can select any of these depending on your what you prefer.23Perhaps the the type of the table itself.24For example, I can select in the medium part of it this format.25The system requests where the data are26in your worksheet.27So you can change it.28This is your table.29The system has normally detected the table on its own.30Indicate if your table has headers, which is the case.31It has 3 headers:32Category, January 16 and January 17.33If we click on OK, the table is formatted directly with the color that we have decided to apply to this table.34If you go back to Home35and ""Format as Table"",36you can change design.37Just by hovering over a color or a type of table,38you have a preview of what would be the result of your different choices.39That's the first possibility to format your table.40There is another one that you can get to in Page Layout.41You have selected your table. On the left part of the ribbon, of the Page Layout tab,42you find different themes.43And again your table is adapted44not only in terms of color, but also in terms of font45and size.46So that's another way to apply a new theme to your table.47Let me just see that very quickly.48So you can decide which theme you prefer to apply to your table.49Then in terms of calculation and table.50Excel is very quick to calculate and analyze data.51Here we have a set of analyses and data.52We are going to see a few things that we can do with the table.53First, you probably know that you can have totals for a column.54If you go to Home, at the far right,55we have an ""AutoSum"" button56that will automatically select the cell in the table.57From the drop-down list, we will be able to decide what the content of this cell will be.58Is it just a sum?59Or it can be the average of this column.60Or it can be the maximum or the minimum value of these data.61Let's try the sum.62On the next cell, the table has been configured with the Format as Table button.63We have select the theme so this last row has been dedicated to the total.64It means that as soon as I have selected my AutoSum,65I can select the drop-down list with what I prefer to have.66On the left, I have the sum of all the figures in the G column.67Here, I have the average number of the H column.68Of course, I change it.69Again, here I have the sum.70What you can also have from here in this table,71in terms of formatting,72is that you can just by clicking anywhere in the table,73if you then go to Data,74you will be able, first, to ask for a filter.75You see that a few arrows, drop-down lists, have been added to each header of my columns.76If I click on the header, I can deselect everything and just see these figures.77These will be for food and I can have my January 16 purchase.78And here, the January 17 purchase.79You can see that the icon has changed, showing that a filter has been applied to this column.80If I click, I see that food has been selected81If I reselect all, I get back all elements.82So that the first possibility to apply filters.83I can have a list of each row being a different value.84It's not very interesting.85But if you have same values and the same columns, in this case you will get all the results of the same value for this column.86So that's the first thing. Another thing that you can do in your table87is to apply a sort.88If you click in the table,89you will be able to decide on which column you can sort.90Here for example, I can say that I want to sort by category.91What would I prefer to sort on:92of course, values.93And I choose, as these are alphabetical values,94I can decide to have A to Z or Z to A95or perhaps even have a custom list.96If I decide to have A to Z97and apply my choice,98my table is ordered in terms of category A, B, etc.99That's the first possibility.100If you click again on Sort, you can choose January 16,101values again, to sort on values,102and here I have Smallest to Largest which I can change to Largest to Smallest.103This time, the whole table will be sorted on January 16 column.104You can see that this is the largest field value, and at the bottom is the smallest value.105You can do it for the last one.106And now you can remove these totals.107These were the first possibilities of formatting.108If I go back to Home,109I can get just beside the Format as Table110something called ""Conditional Formatting"".111Here I have a list of possibilities.112The first one is Highlight Cells Rules.113For example, Greater Than.114If I select this and first I select my table.115Highlight Cells Rules, Greater Than.116I want to see everything that is over 500117in light red.",hello welcom offic 365 mooc training2th topic session see quickli enhanc result excel worksheet3welcom session name charl bonachera go spend next 30 45 minut together4th plan go see littl time range5w see concept tabl specif automat formatting6then see condit format help enhanc tables7then see insert custom sparklines8which someth new offic 20169final see creat custom charts10let go excel11i creat table12and let see custom table13first tabl tabl formatting14in upper part screen know sure15what call ribbon16which chang depend tab select list tabs17her home tab18with ribbon correspond home tab19w find format table20her appear differ type tables21for format22y select depend prefer23perhap type tabl itself24for exampl select medium part format25th system request data are26in worksheet27so chang it28thi table29th system normal detect tabl own30ind tabl header case31it 3 headers32categori januari 16 januari 1733if click ok tabl format directli color decid appli table34if go back home35and format table36y chang design37just hover color type table38y preview would result differ choices39that first possibl format table40ther anoth one get page layout41y select tabl left part ribbon page layout tab42you find differ themes43and tabl adapted44not term color also term font45and size46so that anoth way appli new theme table47let see quickly48so decid theme prefer appli table49then term calcul table50excel quick calcul analyz data51her set analys data52w go see thing table53first probabl know total column54if go home far right55w autosum button56that automat select cell table57from dropdown list abl decid content cell be58i sum59or averag column60or maximum minimum valu data61let tri sum62on next cell tabl configur format tabl button63w select theme last row dedic total64it mean soon select autosum65i select dropdown list prefer have66on left sum figur g column67her averag number h column68of cours chang it69again sum70what also table71in term formatting72i click anywher table73if go data74y abl first ask filter75y see arrow dropdown list ad header columns76if click header deselect everyth see figures77thes food januari 16 purchase78and januari 17 purchase79y see icon chang show filter appli column80if click see food selected81if reselect get back elements82so first possibl appli filters83i list row differ value84it interesting85but valu column case get result valu column86so that first thing anoth thing table87i appli sort88if click table89y abl decid column sort90her exampl say want sort category91what would prefer sort on92of cours values93and choos alphabet values94i decid z z a95or perhap even custom list96if decid z97and appli choice98mi tabl order term categori b etc99that first possibility100if click sort choos januari 16101valu sort values102and smallest largest chang largest smallest103thi time whole tabl sort januari 16 column104y see largest field valu bottom smallest value105y last one106and remov totals107thes first possibl formatting108if go back home109i get besid format table110someth call condit formatting111her list possibilities112th first one highlight cell rules113for exampl greater than114if select first select table115highlight cell rule greater than116i want see everyth 500117in light red
Get Started Excel 2016 - Easily Create Data Synthesis,"Hello and welcome to this short training session on Office MOOC training.This session is from the Get Started with Office training catalogand this particular session is entitled “Excel 2016: Easily Create Data Syntheses”.My name is Steven Ryan and I will be your trainer for this short session.In this session we will look at pivot tables in Excel 2016and the goal of the session is to help you understand how to use Excel pivot tables to analyze and synthesize your data.Let's first briefly discuss what Excel is used for.Although Excel has been around since 1985,its key essential use and purpose hasn't changed much over the years.It is still essentially used for 2 purposes:for calculations and formulas for things like invoicing and accounting and so on,and for the analysis of tables, data analysis and synthesis.This particular training session deals with the second of those Excel uses: data analysis.By being able to analyze all the data in your worksheetit can help you to make better business decisions.Sometimes it's hard to know where to start especially when you've got lots of data.Excel can help you by recommending and then automatically creating pivot tables,which are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore and present your data.There are different kinds of tables in Excel: value tables, calculation tables, invoices...You also get data tables which are always composed of these elements:titles, column headers and value lines.You can see a data table on this slide, which is basically a table with columns and values in it.Let's have a quick demo at some of the quick analysis options in Excel 2016and also to copy some data from a sheet and paste it into a blank sheet and then format it as a tableto get us started so we can move on to look at the data synthesis in the next section.Kick off briefly looking at the flash fill option which can help you to fill in tables of data sometimes.This one is part of the sort of the take a tour welcome to Excel worksheetyou get as part of the templates in Excel 2016.We have to do those start to fill out the table in the right, in the instructions,in the First Name column, we type the first name Nancy,press Enter,then starts typing the next name and you'll seeit picks up straight away, press enter and it will flash fill in the rest of those for you,showing that the value following is the first part of the name in the email address in the first column.It can be very useful for filling in the data that's got a common sequence or theme to it.Let's look at the analysis wizard in here as well.This is a very brief demo part of the take a tour that shows you how to use the quick analysis sheet.All we have to do as stated in the instructions is select the table on the right.I can click and drag the whole tableand when I release the mouse button a little graphic pops up,a little option called ""Quick Analysis"".If I click on that it gives us options for formatting.For example, on this one I have how I want that to be viewed.If I hover over each, you'll see that it updatesto show me what that sort of formatting style looks like.Here I have concepts that shows up and down in values,greater than values, text-based things, we can clear formatting, assign colors and data bars to it...There are also things for charts.You can click on charts and it will show you the sorts of charts you can create out of that data,different styles, scattered charts, bar charts and so on.There's plenty more as well besides.It gives you some options for different types of totaling, like sum and averageand as you hover over it, it actually updatesor the preview of that in the table without actually changing anything. It's a preview of that information.You can add sparklines as wellto your data to show you the movements of data.The most interested one is the Tables option.Let's click on Tables.I get options on the table or pivot tables.It shows us recommended pivot tables available for our dataand how it would be represented.you get a preview of that as you hover over.This one is the sum of the Q1 sales for example,sum of Q2 and the account of the companies listed in that particular table.You can also click on Morewhich shows you other recommended tables, which is the same thing we've already seen,or you can start with a blank pivot table which opens up in a separate sheet.If I click on that, it opens on a separate sheetand allows us to create our own pivot table.I'm going to switch back to that original chart.Now we're going to copy this data,let's copy that across and do this in a different way to show how you can do it manually.We can copyand create a new worksheet,select a celland choose Paste to paste the values themselvesand not bring across any formats or anything, just the values.Then we can resize to make it fit.We can then select part of that dataand we can choose Format as Table.Then we can choose different formatting options for our data, let's choose that one for example.Let's say what's the data source.I select all of it basically. Has it got headers in the table? It has so I select the option and click OK.That gives some formatting to our table.You can choose the style options to change the table style to something else.I'm going to show you how to quickly create pivot tables from that data.I'll switch back to the slides for a moment.You'll see in a moment in the demo how to create a pivot tableand get different areas in the pivot tablein the main area which is on the right side.This one is actually in French, but I'll show you the English one in a moment.There's a section at the top and this is basically fields table title,the pivot table fields area.Then there are 4 other areas on that tabthat lets us do things to assemble an analyze data.That's the filters columns, rows and values areas that we're going to usein the demo coming up shortly to show how they are used.To do that we have to select a cell,any cell in that table,and in the insert tabwe have a pivot tables or recommended pivot tables.If I select ""Recommended Pivot Tables""it gives us the same screen as earlier with the recommended tables we can pick from the listor we can click on ""Blank Pivot Table"".That is essentially the same as if I click on Pivot Table here.It then asks us where we want to create it, what's the range,do we want to use the range that we've selected or use an external data source,do we want to put the pivot table somewhere on this existing worksheet or a new worksheet.I'm going to choose the whole range I've selected and place it on a new worksheet.Click on OK and it will open up a separate sheet.That is Sheet3.We can see this area.Here's where we going to  build our pivot table report on the leftand on the right we can see our pivot table fields section at the topand we can see these other areas below for the assembly filters: columns, rows and values.You've got options to choose fields to add to target.We can either drag or select them.For example, if I select ""Industry""it adds itself to the rows column over there, Rows area.We can also drag and drop.I could grab Q1 sales, drop it into valuesand you see it starts to build up our table.I could do the same for Q2 sales.You could also modify the actual values.If I select the sum of Q1 salesand choose ""Value Field Settings""I got options for how I summarize that data,the type of calculation used to summarize the data.If I change that to Max for example, it now says ""Max of Q1 sales""and the column header also has been changed to say that as well.I'll switch that back to the sum value for the moment.A couple of things to notice here: if I switch back to the original source data sheetand have a look at ""Industry""we've got several industries which are repeated or not.We've got tech, travel, utility (that's 3),beverage (4), medical (5), miscellaneous (6)and then education (7) and financial (8).There's 8 different industries listed there.If I switch back to our sheet,we see 8 industries.That's good information, we know that's right.If you want to add a new row for example,we're going to add a new companyand perhaps we are going to use a new industry:Mandarine BS trainingand we can set some values in there.If we switch back to our pivot tablewe have to refresh that informationand right click anywhere, click on ""Refresh""and you see that the right labels have been added for training and the sum of the sales for Q1 and Q2.We could also add a new column of sales valuesso I'll switch back to our original data source sheet.Let's say we have got a Q3 salesand then populate that with some values.We'll copy some of these values downand then put a different value in for the lastvalue here.Similarly, if we switch back to our pivot table,right-click and click on Refreshand now we've got Q3 sales and I can select thatand it will be added to our values here.I could have dragged it rather than check the box, that's the same thing.Now we've got values for the sum of Q3 sales as well.If we update our data source sheet with different informationand refresh ityou see that those values are updated.Another thing we could also do on is use the company value/fielddrag it to the Filters columnand we will get a filter at the top of the screen.I could then filter different information on different companies.I want to look at Mandarine only so I select that one to see that information.You can also check the ""Select Multiple Items"" checkbox and select multiple values,click on OK and we'll see multiple values that way.Then go back to select all,choose OK and we're back to original values.This provides a really simple way of representing your data,presenting your data a different way or looking at it from different perspectives,different values and assigning different filters, different field settings,different calculations to base our summary information on as well.To summarize:pivot tables are way of analyzing and providing automatic syntheses of your data,including if you've got really large amounts of data, it can be very useful and it's automatic.You can also customize everything:you can customize the formulas, formatting, order, sorting and so on.Remember to right click the mouse and choose refresh after you modify your source data.Data syntheses with Pivot tables in Excel is really easy to use, there's really no need to be an expert in data since you can work and get some real value from it.That concludes this short session.Thank you attention and we hope that you can make the best use of this training going forward.",hello welcom short train session offic mooc

Word 2016 - Introduction to word processing,"Welcome to the surface 365 training. The session, which is about to start is related to a big topic, which is called get started with a face and the subject of the session is just to have an introduction to work processing and I work processing we?Introduction to the Microsoft Word which is in the Office 365 switch the word processing software application welcome. So to the session. My name shall Bernard Shaw and we're going to spend the next 3245 minutes.What will be discussing during this time here is the plan we will first discovered interface quick discovery of the interface with it at the layout? How is it distributed in the screen then we will see how to create and format text? Which is?Um of uhm well, then we will see that we can apply styles starts, which are provided by the application to work quicker and more efficiently. We will see how to make changes to the.And all the changes that we have that we may may have an form that can also track and at the end, we see how to save the document. The different possibilities that we have to save documents on our locally in our computer or using the functionality's office.T 5 online that is on the cloud in the cloud to save documents and possibly to share them if needed. The goal of this session clearly to discover Microsoft Word and quickly create documents on arrow.So let's start by using?Word, which isHere.And the first time you open word you will arrive on the home page on the left and see a list of documents the least just called recent so this week last week and all the documents of course, very, very first time that you.Open this page. This list with the course and will be populated each time you open a new document or you created new document on the left part of the screen. As you can imagine just by having a look at it. Lots of templates are provided to you.Each's name that suggests his function for example, that you're a creative resume design by some design format creative cover letter for each coverage are block post just you.A question of blog, etc, etc. But for the purpose of this session, which is to discover the 2. We will start with the blank document blank page. And for that very first template even empty template to blank document that I will select and I selected it. Of course, but you get you.Is of course the blank page blank document that would be exactly the case? When we start to write in a notebook are open on a piece of paper blank page. And now it would be up to us to write down and here to create.Use of all the functions of Microsoft Word just a quick words on the interface again asking the rest of the office, which we can hear find the text.Uh each top related to a topic UM in search designs. Of course, the design of the page. The layout other page. References would be to get the references inside the page etc. If we want to perform mailings to have review of.In terms of spelling and grammar for example, to check the spelling and grammar if we want to work to count the word. Exeter out interview. It's everything that is at our view, which is visual and that we can change directly from this step for each.Underneath we found what's called the ribbon and that you may probably knew from other office applications. Each time you change the tab the the ribbon adapts to the new tab? Of course, providing you the most common and the?Just usual commands that are related to one tab and you are supposed to be looking for when you select the tab. So here in the home page. The main goal of word.Treatment of course in the homepage. We've got everything that will help us create a document what we need to know with word is that of course, you can write text. I laugh.Prepared.Something, which is supposed to be an introduction to work assessing for example, yeah, um so here you can write anything and just.Start writing things.In theInside the document.So here for example, this is.And.Introductions.OK, So what you can see if it's bad for the system.Underlies, What's supposed to be wrongly spelled you can change. Of course, you can see also here that um the text is in certain formats. But you can write it here font. There is this grouping. This elected to the fonts and here we know which.And you see that there are lots to your disposal and the size here. Other functions so you can also increase and you see that just by selecting or or hovering over the the the figures values you can see the result on screen.So if you want to change the font size very easily the same for the thought it's tough.So here is a Gency FB, Adjarian Outback Ling, etc. So there is no need to select and change each time so losing time again to go faster to what is needed you can just by hovering over the name of?You see instantly see the resource that's the first thing regarding the context. But by defaults. This will propose you calibrate here for example, and you change the the size if needed again to keep here in front of you that you can.On many other things, if you want to have it in both you just select code too. If you if you want to reverse it to normal just click again here is it leak and line etc.And again reverse the color of the font can be changed and see either on the word which you selected or you just select the whole trace of the whole line and you can change it again here and you see again the result.We produced so that you can cite even the background can be changed. If you need it and of course, even here, there is a well art that is, and you can adapt to your document that's the.But there is an important concept in terms of we got word is that?Hey, beautiful, I have right?Something there is a concept that is important to to know I understand is that the notion of paragraph uhm.If youJust right of course words text kilometric format that is to say without thinking and just entering onscreen the text.The system considers that it is the same paragraph.To show the system that you are changing the paragraph you have to press on the keyboard the?Cheat the enter key.And now you see that the system as.Gone to the beginning of the next line and there now you can start again and you.Paragraph and now the system will consider.All that is written here, I'm just of course, is a metric ass paragraph this one.OK, so.That is interesting and important to know that if you click just in the middle of the paragraph because again this is considered by word as an entire paragraph. You will have the possibility just in the home tab here in the paragraph grouping to format and.Adopt theParagraph itself.For example, he will see that Vardy fault. If we have a look at the paragraph group. We see that here. This is marked checked. It means that the alignment is left and if you leave your cursor if you hover over this part, you see that gives you.Uh align you content with the left margin. That means that if you want to change the alignment to center, you just need to.Put the cursor of the mouse in the middle of the paragraph anywhere. And just by clicking here now center. The whole paragraph is centered and you can see that here.I mean, just copy this.Here this one is unaffected by my previous to ship this you should so this is a paragraph. This is another one, and that's very important when you start writing a text here because the system each time you press the key the enter key on a keyboard.Then the next text to be a new paragraph and it will be formatted totally differently. If we know so that you can format or different paragraph independency, so of course again, you see this paragraph has been scented, UM this one.Can youTo copy text this one, so it's not the point that that shows that it is a new paragraph. It's really. When you enter press the enter key on the keyboard.I can now if I select this D lineman is this type right you see that this near aligned. This is Judy centered and I kept to the same with another.Paragraph and it could be also different uhm.OK so if I click third paragraph, I can have it at it, said here is justify, meaning that both left and right text is exactly adjusted to the to my page weather.Alright Here it is not OK will see that here there is an indentation act so that's the very first possibility that you have with the new paragraphs is the possibility to decide about the alignment justification is it justified centered is just.Not that first thing then again, there is known each at my supposed to select the whole paragraph just by keeping the mouse cursor in the middle of it, you see that here you can also modify the line.Paradise spacing so if you click you see that you have here 1115. One 2:30 contacts to see if the line spacing between the line. Of course, spacing between lines so you can add space before paragraph. Remove space after paragraph and if you want to.Just to keep we see that document is.Justify all right, and we can decide about the indentation so we can hear the indentation. You see that the the whole paragraph is distributed to the right part of the screen, OK remember control pressure control, she ends.Key at the same time to reverse who get back by the words just over there in the very, very belper left corner of the screen. You get undo typing here or of course. We do the last command here lines X and it was OK.Paint the spacing you can change.The the the space between the lines of your paragraphs very important, um of course, you see in this paragraph here. But other possibilities. If you want to see each time there.Sing a grouping of commands here this little haro, you can click and again to the full options of the paragraph formatting with sometimes even examples here, OK, you can see what would be the result of our choice.Terms of indentation spacing general alignment for example, or outline level line and page breaks. If we need also which is something different that we not discuss here, but again so.Are the different possibilities of formatting your paragraph in terms of?Paragraph you see that here is a command, which will increase or decrease index. If you preach here, you see that the whole paragraph will be indented.Uh so.That's a possibility to indent each time you press indentation is one way further to the right. Of course, you can go back and wait further chooser left that's another possibility so remember each time.You press the enter key you change paragraph something that you can do. Also, if you can create lists an example if you enter fire up witcher?Yeah.Is the least so you can first go to the spacing to change the spacing?English or at space or OK. That's the minimum, but now you can also with this little.Sure glitch library select bullets in France at the first possibility if you select.This if you just enter you see that all the least will.Take the same tool, it's something also here if you select complete you can have to see but just list with number alignment left here number alignment left also but differently spelled you can think of this.Um the alignment based on the on letters.So different etc. So of course, if you select this one issue and to fix. It will take the number threes number 5. Sorry that's why they just released also possible here library list in this case.Sorry. The Library of Mr. Now this time, if I enter you see that by default. GPU Indent, one uhm one further to the right the bullets in front is changing OK.Little but you can also.Can alsoSelect sure and request for?These and in this case if after fire we decide to Indent. Once that we did. One dot one for example, a chapter a paragraph first paragraph within.Um set paragraph and you see third level folks level etc. So each time can bring you controls. It reverts different possibilities. You see here. You can do the same with good. It's always so you can have.Used creative andSame for chapters you see.Chapter in disturb you but the truth 123 and 4 based on these templates that you have here OK uhm.So very interesting, too, great performer a kind of hierarchy OK with this.Least library that you can select to mix to meet Unix or so in paragraph. You can you see that you can just buy again now leaving the cursor in the paragraph you can change?The content and you don't need to select it just hovering over you can change and see the changing.Zip ground oh uh what you can also do is you can change the complete style of the program here. We were very few things in fact, but if you look at the ribbon just over Matthew page. You'll see that there are.Our group, which is called stars and by default, you see that the normals Titans applied to do the whole text. In fact now. If you want to change it if you again, let hover over the each style you can see.Can.You can change this time, um be careful for heading in heading 2. These are a body changes. Of course, but it's based for for example, if you want them to have a table of contents by selecting heading one. This would be considered then set up contacts.Jected unset chapter, she would be a title of a page so for example, if we insert a page break whoever another page if I.Uh.Now you can have.Spice Gonna die, too, and you see that it is considered night title.The subtitle brings on K so you can completely adapt.Uh so for each page. You have a statue was the title. So you pretty. She just use styes and again, you don't need to select everything if you select your?A paragraph use instantly was becoming a what would become new paragraph if you change the style of your?A bit of also, if you could hear again as not just we did in the paragraph styles. You can get the whole anyway went together, so she works a whole lot of.Change.Styes available.Sick rather preview you can see here after lots all those dives that you can modify here in your.You're a document other things that you can do in your document you can so that posts for matching the stars, which in the hierarchy. If you you of course, can do different things. If we go to the.Again, we see that you can change.The whole.Document and then when you have the title, the title will be changed here also.So you can change the whole.Again, the the titles will be that way. The Headings with the EC here centered here. It's on the right so again. You can also use these documents for matching Doc to format the whole document.Right so if you go there.See title because are different so you can also format here.Features also Indesign you can have different seems that right in terms of colors is our cause or in terms of swarf fonts stop changing so lots of things that you can do directly change both for matching styles and.And seemsYou go back to normal to the home tab. We can also insert lots of things pictures to insert a picture.For example, this one.OK, I really receipt in another session training. Another AV 365 training what you can do with the pictures. Lots of things. Uhm so you can insert many things into your document so meaning that you can really have a long document, which is.Complete and really, really, really am.A powerful so the application is really powerful to adapt to your needs again and your preferences.

Word 2016 - Discover DTP with word,"Welcome to this Office 365 training.2This session is included in the big topic called: ""Get Started with Office"".3This session's subject will be the discovery of desktop publishing with Word.4We are going to use Microsoft Word5and in particular the desktop publishing capacities of Word6which are quite interesting when you try to create some commercial documents for instance.7Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we are going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together.8What will we be discussing during this time range?9We will see how to work with pictures in Microsoft Word,10how we can insert pictures.11Then we will see how to insert shapes and text boxes,12which is quite interesting because you don't have to design on your own the shapes and text boxes.13Some are automatically inserted when we decide it.14Then we will see how to insert automatic charts and graphics.15At the end, we will see how to export and share documents16so that clients, customers or colleagues can take these documents into account in their own actions and tasks.17The goal of this session is to discover Microsoft Word Desktop publishing features18which are very interesting and powerful.19So let's start from the beginning, for that let's go to Word.20It will open in a second, here it is coming.21Very first thing you have on Word,22you have on the left a list of the most recent documents23that have been open with Word.24Of course it will be empty but as soon as you start working with Word, the list will be populated with new documents.25On the right, there are templates that you can use to avoid losing time when creating some documents.26They are already created for you.27At least, you have to then adapt and update the content.28For the the purpose of this session29I'm going to open a blank document.30A blank document.31When you need to write a document, a letter, anything, you have to start writing.32Here we are taking into account the desktop publishing capacities of Word.33For that, I'm going to show you lots of tricks and functions that are available directly on Microsoft Word.34One word on the interface:35The old menus are now composed of tabs.36Each tab gives access to a lot of actions and commands37related to its subject.38For example, Insert and insertion.39We will soon be using that because that's mainly the core of this session.40All actions and commands related to insertions of documents or whatever41are available in the ribbon.42If I change to design, I get other commands.43So let's have a look from the beginning.44Here is the first thing that you can do for example.45Let me start a document.46You're going to have the title of the document.47We can increase the size.48When you are in the Home tab, you can see that styles are available.49With styles, you can change the style applied to your document50and to your text.51Here, for example, it is ""Intense Emphasis"".52Wherever you are in the text, if you want to emphasize something,53you can select in the styles,54in the options ""Intense Emphasis"" for example.55Otherwise, for example, just ""Title"".56I will show you what you can do with text.57If we go to the Insert tab,58which we will soon be exploring more,59at the far right,60you find something called, in the text command group, ""Drop Cap"".61For example, you can instantly increase the size of the first letter,62here is an example,63as you may find in a document,64some kind of documents, in some books, for example,65but not not only.66You can even decide which fonts you will use.67If you select for example, Algerian,68you can also change the lines to drop.69Here you have a first example of the desktop publishing possibilities.70I will enter a text with a capital letter.71That's my text.72The first interesting thing in terms of publishing in Word73is for example,74in the pictures.75You can insert pictures in your document.76If I go there, for example,77and insert this picture,78my picture will instantly be inside the document.79But not only.80You can insert the picture wherever you are,81and you can then move it to where you want to move it.82But if we look at the newly open Picture Tools tab,83Format Picture Tools,84you can see that you have the possibility to correct your picture.85For example, here,86sharpening the picture.87If you go back, you can also change the brightness and contrast of the color.88Each time you hover over this, you can see the result in your own picture.89That's the first possibility.90If you go to the next function available,91you can change the color saturation,92the color tone...93Well, have an action on the colors of your picture.94For example, here I can over-saturate it in terms of color,95to have a more shocking blue, a strong blue, and even an orange sand.96That's another possibility.97If we continue with this, you can even apply artistic effects to your picture.98Like this.99So that's like a painting.100If we look at the Picture Styles,101you can even change the style of the picture itself.102For example, you can change the position of the picture,103you can apply edges.104If you want to have something more precise,105you can right-click,106Format Picture,107you have on the right the possibility to access all the functions and for example, change the transparency.108Or even change the artistic effects.109So there are many possibilities in terms of actions on pictures.110When you select the picture, in terms of layout options,111you can decide how the text will be wrapped around the picture.112Here it is in line with text, but you can also text wrap and change it.113The way the system will interact with the picture, it will interact with your text by moving it.114The way the text will be wrapped around the picture.115If you look at the rest of the ribbon116you can see that you can compress the picture, change the picture, reset the picture,117change the border.118In terms of borders, you can change the borders.119There are many available functions to start working in terms of publishing on your document.120It is possible to insert pictures, but not only.121If we go to Insert,122We can see that we can insert online pictures,123in this case you will have access to Bing, for example,124to ask for more pictures.125In this case, you will be able to enter other pictures126from the web this time127and in this case you will be able to apply effects128to what you have or change the layout129and resize the picture,130which is one of the most interesting possibilities.131If we go back to Insert,132we have seen online pictures,133you can also insert shapes.134If you insert a shape, you can write on it.135If you click on the shape,136you see that there's a Format tab137in the Drawing Tools that can allow you to you change instantly the color of the shape,138apply a WordArt,139style, to the letters inside.140And you have a lot of possibilities available.141You can also increase or decrease the size of the text.142There are a lot of possibilities in terms of shape.143If you go to the shapes, there are a lot of shapes that you can use:144arrows, if you want to show something.145You just have to change anything146and you can have text inside.147So there are also many possibilities in terms of shapes, but not only.148I will continue to show you other publishing possibilities.149If we go to the Insert tab,150you can insert shapes and icons151but you cannot insert SmartArt.152This is very interesting if, for example, you have to describe a process in a commercial document.153For example, I inserted SmartArts and I will have my process described in a few seconds.154There are 2 tabs this time: Design and Format.155In the Format tab, I can change the format.156Here the style is polished.157With Insert, etc., I can change158and apply the style that I prefer.159We can change the way the picture interacts with the text.160You can also instantly try other layouts161for the same purpose.162So you can even change your mind and select another SmartArt or continue exploring different styles.163You can even change the color to have something more corresponding to your needs:164the color of your logo or whatever.165If you have a chart inside your company, for example.166SmartArt: if I continue exploring, because it's very interesting,167first you can also have screenshots.168You can,169if you select ""Screenshot"", you see that you have all the windows that open to select the one from which you want to have a screenshot170that could be included in your document, here for example.171You can resize it .172You can decide how it will interact with it.173Right here, you can change the way the text will interact.174It's very interesting because in a few seconds we are going to include something which is on another window175and it is a really interesting feature,176for example, something from the Internet.177That thing that I wanted you to see 178the insertion of a chart.179All the charts, for example Excel, are available in the bar.180If you select a bar, a pie, the system will include a pie181and you can change the content, the caption.182For example, since a date.183You can then decide whether you want to have the data labels,184you can change the style of your pie.185So there are many possibilities.186I like this one.187You can even separate with a click.188So there are many possibilities with the insertion of charts,189pretty much as if you were in Microsoft Excel.190You can even filter the data.191So there are very powerful possibilities.192If I stay in Insert,193I can also instantly insert a textbox at the far right.194You can select it195and move it where you want.196Each time you have a new object: Drawing Tools, Format.197You can instantly change the shape styles.198You can change the WordArt applied to its text.199If you right-click on that,200you can even201insert a caption.202Here is my caption and it can be modified in terms of font and size.203Everything is resized instantly.204So with Insert you can do a lot of things,205mainly inserts textboxes,206different styles of textboxes that you then will be able to modify and you can edit points if you want to change the size of the caption.207Text also is available and you can change it to have another kind of stylish layout.208These are part of the possibilities that you can apply to a Word document and is this way209have Word closer to a desktop publishing tool than just to a writing tool.210If we go back, we will see how to export and share.211If you go to File, in Export,212you will be able to create a PDF document.213and in this case click on ""Create PDF"".214You will also have a possibility to share.215You have all these functions available:216""Share with People"", in this case you will have to save to the cloud first, and on OneDrive or SharePoint on the web.217You can share it as usual by email218and sent as attachment, send PDF, etc.219You also have the possibility to present your document online220with a new function of Microsoft that you can discover in another MOOC training.221You can send by instant messaging with Skype from Office 365,222or post it on a blog, well, you have a lot of possibilities, or save it on a drive online or on your PC223if you decide and in this case you can browse your PC to save your document wherever you want.224So different possibilities online or on your computer.225We we have seen a lot of possibilities in terms of publishing.226I hope it has been useful and helpful.227Thank you for attending this session228and I hope that you can make the best use of it.229Thank you, bye bye.",welcom offic 365 training2thi session includ big topic call get start office3thi session subject discoveri desktop publish word4w go use microsoft word5and particular

Collaborating on a document without confusing the different versions,"You are working with variousassociates on writing a new contract template.

In addition, by clicking on Edit document and then on Edit in browser, I access a Word version online that allows me to work on the documentdirectly from the browser.Word Online looks similar to theapplication installed on my computer.I can add text, insertgraphics and hypertext links, work with the table tool, etc.The main functionalitiesof the ribbon in the Officeapplication are availablein the online application.When I finish editing my document,Word Online saves it automatically.I can then returndirectly to my document library.I would now like todiscuss the notion of versioning,which is very topical today.

Managing personal and work-related agendas at work,"Your work station and yourvarious devices were set upquickly and you arenow using your tools.Your agenda has beenautomatically synchronized with your Smartphone and your tablet.This encourages you topopulate your agenda and to takeadvantage of this abilityto use it at any location.But a few questions come to mind.If you share your devicewith your assistant or your associates, is there a wayto hide certain appointments?Do you really have tocreate a second calendar for your private or personal appointments?Would this not be cumbersome and annoying?In Outlook, if you simplywant to share your calendar sothat a colleague can check your agenda from his or her work station, select the calendar module.Right click on the calendarthat you wish to share anduse the Share, Share calendar option.You can also use the Sharecalendar button located on the ribbon.Just like for an email, youchoose the person to whom you will send this sharing notification.Then all you need to do is send it.If you want to assign adelegation on your calendar, go to the File, Accountsettings, Delegate access tab.In this window, click onAdd and then select the personwho will be your delegate. Secondly, choose the authorizationsyou wish to get your delegate.In this case, we will keepthe editor functionality.This person will be able to read,create and edit components in my calendar.Primarily, I want to beable to enter my personalappointments in myprofessional account.I will therefore uncheckthe option that allows the delegation to see mypersonal information.This way when I create a newpersonal appointment, I will only have to check theprivate option to prevent my delegate from seeing thedetails of my personal appointments.Here is a practical example.I create an appointment.This appointment is private. When I createit, I check the private boxwhich will hide all thedetails in spite of the delegation.When my assistant opens mycalendar, he or she will beable to see the details ofmy work related appointments,but will not be able toaccess the details of the appointments marked as private. This convenient option allows me to use the same calendar for both my work-related appointmentsand my personal appointments.When you delegate and shareyour agenda, you're always incontrol of the people whocan access your calendar andthe authorizationsthat they're given.You can feel secure knowingthat when you have marked an appointment as private, it will becompletely hidden in any type of sharing.Thank you for your attention.",work station yourvari devic set upquickli arenow use toolsyour agenda beenautomat synchron smartphon tabletthi encourag topopul agenda takeadvantag abilityto use locationbut question come mindif share devicewith assist associ wayto hide certain appointmentsdo realli tocreat second calendar privat person appointmentswould cumbersom annoyingin outlook simplyw share calendar sothat colleagu check agenda work station select calendar moduleright click calendarthat wish share andus share share calendar optiony also use sharecalendar button locat ribbonjust like email youchoos person send share notificationthen need send itif want assign adeleg calendar go file accountset deleg access tabin window click onadd select personwho deleg secondli choos authorizationsy wish get delegatein case keepth editor functionalitythi person abl readcreat edit compon calendarprimarili want beabl enter personalappoint myprofession accounti therefor uncheckth option allow deleg see myperson informationthi way creat newperson appoint check thepriv option prevent deleg see thedetail person appointmentsher practic examplei creat appointmentthi appoint privat createit check privat boxwhich hide thedetail spite delegationwhen assist open mycalendar beabl see detail ofmi work relat appointmentsbut abl toaccess detail appoint mark privat conveni option allow use calendar workrel appointmentsand person appointmentswhen deleg shareyour agenda your alway incontrol peopl whocan access calendar andth authorizationsthat theyr giveny feel secur knowingthat mark appoint privat becomplet hidden type sharingthank attent

How can you gather all these ideasand reflections in one place?How can you encourage everyoneto participate in this initiative?Yammer is an enterprise social network organized around the concept of groups. In particular, I want to create a working group to discuss ways ofimproving the quality of our services.Yammer has all the toolsneeded to create an opencommunication space thatwill allow you to manage this invitation to a large number ofassociates to contribute their ideas.For this purpose, I willcreate a specific group that I will call Quality improvement. I click on Create a groupand a window openswhere I can set up my group.I can create a group forinternal collaboration or a group that would be open toother people outside my organization.I indicate the name of the group.Here I can write the namesof guests or future members,if there aren't too many. But in my case, I want to involve a lot of people.I will then do a massimport after creating my group.Finally, I need tochoose the type of group.There are two typesavailable in Yammer: public, anyone in this network can viewconversations and post, and private, by invitation or by request to the administrator, only group memberscan view conversations and posts.In my case, I willstay with a public group.The group has now been createdwith various tabs on the page.The Conversations tab isat the very core of Yammer.This is where everyonecan give their opinion.The New Conversations tabwill only display conversationsthat you have not yet seen.The Files tab takes you tothe library of files thatmembers can post with theirconversation or reflectionand the Notes tab allowsyou to share important ideaswith your colleagues who canthen add items to this note to develop it further. For now, there are no members, so I will do an import. To do this, I will click on the wheel icon to set up the group.On this page, I have twochoices for adding members:either one at a time orusing an import function.In this case, I'm choosingthe import function as I want to invite many associates. I prepared my comma-separated values file beforehand by exporting a contact file from Outlook.All I need to do now is tolook for my CSV file to import it.Once the import has beencompleted, guests will benotified and will be able toaccess the group directly byclicking on the linkin the notification.Everyone will be able tosuggest new ways of improvingthe quality of our services.

only remains to choosethe members of my organizationand my group is created.After a few weeks,the group has been very active.When I want to consult the elements,it's very simple.I use my email to find thedifferent groups to which I belong.As an owner of this group,I can add membersor modify the group at any time.All data files collected for this studywere placed in the library of group files.A fairly complete database is available to meand I want to use appropriate tablesto best analyze these figures.This table does not allowa simple interpretation of the figures.Using this database,it is possible to synthesize the figuresso as to enhance my results.For this, the segments addedto a Pivot Table are valuable tools.They allow some resultsto be visually highlightedwithout any additional input.Just playing with the segment filtersallows the results table and graphicsto be refreshed automatically.In addition, beyond the usual graphics,I would like my data to generate a mapthat can indicatemy BBQ sales geographically.My data table containsgeographic coordinatesthat the 3D maps optionintegrated with Excel can use.In a few clicks,I can get a geographic view of my sales.For more complete presentations,maps can record a videoof the map with different views.This will make my presentation clear,interesting and exciting.I integrate the video into PowerPoint.The graphics and the

External group and in this case you have to add people that maybe from outside your company and then just decide whether which persons will be able to see your conversation and post messages.You're only members from other networks, soaproot, members from other networks, so other yammer groups or only members from this book that you are creating at this exact moment, so once you have created so I will not create another one that takes us to create another.This one for example, an external group what will be the advantages of creating group web. Many the first one, is that you can instantly have new conversations with the whole campus or the whole list of member that means that you can instantly share.Communicate with all the people of course, just posting welcome message for example. Of course, any other information that you may find interesting during the management of the project. So here you will have the possibility to create new conversations and J 2 C.Missions to help with post this one and of course, you can see also.Or other conversations interesting things in terms of communication regarding the situation. The first situation in such can again so create share something with a group you can create your pool that's very interest.In terms of of communication if you need to care for advice from other members members or if you need a 12 jacket decision so that's very, very.Which way to go for example?And then you have, I think this was all 3 answers OK, UM next?My phone.Hello.And you see that you can even each time you can have add another answer for the reason if you if you take this other possibility to have fixed one and 61, etc. You can add people to modify and if you post. This all members of the group, which will see the.Be able to answer.Of course, you will be able to underwrite you see here members, so you can add more people. So here for example, I have persons included members already members as it is an external group, which is private you can see this year, only members will see.Good one Sir, but then you will be able to chain to give a new update a Newport praise someone enter the name of the person that you want to to praise so for example, this one. What are you present for is content constant sorry?Moment.It means that you rank your project over around the project you can really.Uhm I know, but give life to your project through new conversations pause phrase pronouncements. So you have all the possibilities in terms of communications first change in terms of communication on the right part where we?Does he have the possibility of course is such a group she looking for something that she will see something which is called info. And here it should click on it, it will be able to add a cannula. Edit you can add a Lynx or of course information so she is the new information at just copy the link so if.Life is a possibility you have to create a link to something interesting share for example, the peace at least information.Um dedicated to the group and related to the the activity of a group share pins. You can even have documents so they could get select from the fight on yammer, meaning in one of the Yammer groups.Or just adding from your OneDrive when drafting you know the storage space that is given to you via the company by Office 365 and in this case you can explore all your OneDrive 5 because you may have several personal.No.Professional personal once over Tibet also group ones share point once and in this case, one of your fish. The groups you are member of which are storage points in this case you can explore them and who and find a document.Different that you can link so from one who you may drink a document to another one, so that's what's very just so in terms of collaboration. Still, you can if we go there and you have included in the Yammer group, so this is the name of the group again so you.Conversations or conversations that have something called 5. That's again, the storage point, which is given to you. And when we will put 2 documents from your own computer. Of course, instantly all members of the group would be able.To see.So here for example, and you can select the files so you can approve document. What is interesting in this case is that everybody of course has access to people when I need everybody and everybody from the group everybody can.On the document and you as owner of the document.You can identify continue to file and you are, and you can decide whether this document is you want or not. We can see here that I have. I have declared this document being the last one if should mark so I can remove this?Fuck and this document would be the change between the possible for all members to identified and chill. I consider being the owner that the document is finished so you can still relate contents to his file. You know which other flours well. Lots of information in terms of communication jobs.Of course in terms of collaboration because if you needed to file.The system, which truck all the changes and it will be very easy to restore a previous version, so for example, an Excel can't of course. I want to change the document the chart here.Change the chart type I change it to chat dressing things. Also, which is not only related Yammer Group. Let Office 365 storage. You don't need to to say you're so she closed things document you can see the comments with.Let's see um seized meaning that you cannot point you can reverse so we store. A previous version, so that's very interesting in terms of document management so in terms of if you have related project, which is not too heavy don't.Buy lots of activities of management again in terms of document communication collaboration and what so ever. You can use this younger group, which gives you access to a lot of things.In terms of in terms of cleanup project management like this, because you have communication with everybody. But you have pauses will instantly know what people think of your or get about some from all people, you can praise people.Cool behavior that's very interesting and important to our people are oppressed by you are by your management and all the possibilities again of collaboration and and and which is a tablet not at least the possibility to have mixed groups with people from inside.Why don't you are?Off yourCompany so I will push you man hope that's the vote. So we can really wear. Many committees to like conversation should we try to conversation to share a conversation with someone else also meant another group visuals about write a reply of course attached document.Images of collaboration communication with a project again not too big is available in the Yammer group, so that's very, very interesting. The first possibility he's here to to organize groups general.Enterprise social network.Test possibility interesting thing, which is available to Office 365.So instantly again we can share all the documents for complete review from anywhere at anytime. I remind you that each you are connected to the Internet. You only need the things just the connection itself. Then you just have your credentials once connected to Office 365 online you have access to OK.Your calendar and these gamma goods that you can manage from anywhere again and it anytime anywhere from the word in the world and at anytime of course, wherever you want? How to organize their affection around in shoe. We've seen that because you can even ask again. Pull up document shared.Citra how to exchange pretty with those indicated stakeholders because instantly when you use gamma group to deliver conversations in your own mailbox stupid received the conversations so if I open?OK.Sure, I have the conversation in the test extreme group is ready, so all newcomers and notifications in my neighbors and I will even able to answer to this group conversation direct and we see that when you are yeah, been added to test.Speech using a general the second one is was 2 net reflection workshops around training. It means that you have to organize workshops. So the different possibility that you face is to try to manage the organization of this event, even more difficult than statement is our.So external busters and in general partners, therefore, reducing that but we found another solution how to centralized exchanges between the various stakeholders. We have seen that. The Yammer Group was first possibility. I will show you another one, and I want to give an attractive and created dimension presentation or of course, is implying.PowerPoint and I will show you a few things about over so the first possibility was the Yammer Group, which again is not is that it for a not treat project. The others, which you may have to again communicate and share information is the.So what is the working within the Yammer Group, which is mostly self and the enterprise social network here is really something different you can create working group from 2 places 2 locations one on your computer?The the chance to have outlook office 2016 installed on your computer and enough history 2016 to an outlook. Of course, so you can from our group, creative groups. Otherwise, you have also the possibilities to go again in Office 365 online and office 3.I'm sure you also you can create groups and even change groups to to include external guests from from External Company. So when you are in outlook in your mailbox. You have here of course in the home tab you have.In the end of the ribbon you have a new group, which is called groups and share us by pattern code new cook. So the group. The new group Working Group is not to be missed.Miss with the the distribution list keep is not a distribution list as the pop-up says that could provides a place for shared compensations 5 and a group calendar and that's a big difference with the Yammer group immigrants the social network.You can do many things here, the difference is that you have one difference is that you have included in the creation of the group of Google calendar. So if you choose a name for your group once you have decided whether it's public or private group and once.Other members will whether you want to subscribe new members so that they also receive group conversations in their inbox, meaning that they don't need to be connected to the group. They will receive both in their group in mailbox and in their personal inbox also conversations once you have.You will find the groups in your account so in your mailbox at the end of your older folders. There will be a new one code groups where you will find all the groups that you have been added to web first crab.I've been added as members, so she I have already far groups that effective and more I can even have.4 and of course I will get all my list of new groups.With of course, the same behavior. As for the rest of the folder here from this group to these 2 means that I have 2 unread messages. So if I go to the text external, she's group again. I see that I asked to.Green and red so it means that he had it to the folder group you will find all the groups. You again member of to share this one. I member of another one, etc. This is welcome message OK. Welcome to the outlook customer manager.You can start a conversation a few group flies on active ET cetera. I will show you what it means and if I get to 6 extent. I fuck shit. The different composition, but that's not the only interesting thing in the groups working groups if you look.Tab and in the ribbon you see that we are in the conversation, meaning that these are the conversations between all the group first and its members or between different members.Here, I can.Create a new conversation.And buy new conversation is the new Mary, new message 20 minutes, you would with you on.Mailbox but you can see that this message is addressed or intended to the whole group, meaning that this will be instantly received as a conversation in the group.Or easier versus crap members directly they will receive the message thing in their own inbox personally inbox professional personal inputs, so you can now instantly send a message to all the group, so that's very interesting.Now I think they also a calendar, which is shared the whole group and calendar here.You see that there is also a group in the folder pane of of the calendar. You can right click. The request a new point. Modern new meeting request and if you ask for one of these again again again the.Quest will be.Sent to the whole group of course, you get a couple but also it means that you also have all the functions of Outlook scheduling your systems, the possibility to have categorized G possibility to have the chance of each meeting for group for example, you have to plan.Um every current meeting each morning each Monday morning. For example, with Poles Member Group. You don't need to ever send them 10 minutes. If you have 10 members just send one day and it will be received and everybody will receive.The the the request a meeting request in terms also of in terms of managing the.Meetings request you have a new functionality that will be that you will be able to use in your management of these coordination reflection workshops. Organizacion see for example, you have something new, which is called new meeting point if you check.Which is called fun time you will be requested to link outlook or your account now joke with this Phantom application and if an issue select link now you will be.Connected to find time you will need to connect to your user account against.And.So I'm connecting to find time and once connected you will be able when you create a new request. New meeting request or even if you answer to Maine. You can answer with these new meeting port and you can instantly see.So you instantly are able to select time for your meeting you see. Now that's deselected if you click on next so you can of course, you have several options that you will have to discover the working hours of course again.How to set up the the time zone the duration of the meeting by default and if you click on next in this case.Location it can be an online meeting with you, even tell you about this one machine. That's also an issue in search to mail in your mail. You have and you creation request of meeting so this is not a traditional.Is really amazed that you send to people proposing an invitation and people will select when they received the mail?They received the mail they will be able to select.Um options so whether they accept or not so we are not in the traditional meeting request. It's a new way of communicating in terms of reactivity that was one of the of the states other things like that where it sticks.So.Uh now in the each people receiving this request without once I guess I agree with this time, no, I don't so you can answer mail by just sending this reply again, which you have here and reply with meeting full so again that will.With which you can instantly find time for a meeting between you and your correspondence here train one.So very interesting new feature so again when you create a group you have.This conversations with everybody where everybody can do the conversations participate into the conversations like the conversations, etc, etc. You have a calendar to prepare meetings with anybody from the group instantly with all peep.Uh but it was also nice.Which is a storage online where you will be able to?Shadow clicks.Sure, there.So this and see the place where you will be able to upload document size.So once they are uploaded it would be able to scan the document with anybody.From your organization from the outside very easy so it will be different from the other group, which was dedicated to only the members of group with a percentage to share with the outside, where I would say here once you select a doc.Share it.Of course in here, you have access to your directory, but you can get an inch and we fixing people from outside your enterprise will be able to view or edit. The document so the new whales communicate you cannot imply people from outside.Good point so you people don't need to be member of the group. But at any time you can share this document with people from outside so again when we get back to 2 AM.To outlook again, we have this conversation, she mailbox probably the calendar files and even a notebook that you can share with the old member groups to share right notes that are online and will be accessible from anywhere at anytime so lots of posts.With his new book, if you need to access or to be a twist change between the various stakeholders instantly. There is a possibility well. I have 2 added excited just that I don't know why.Um.This version that I cannot keep it disappears only time but if you are in the calendar of your group, so of course, we've seen that here have positive.Appointment but I can have a new meeting request. But if you get to the top here admitting there is something new, which is called Skype meeting so if you should take on Skype meeting uhm you can either instantly of course, you can even.Is Skype meeting later? What you described meeting with Katie on meeting online that you flat? What is interesting here is that whoever received this meeting invitation so of course members of the group but?Finally, people from anywhere because you can even add people from outside so anybody receiving this.Meeting request with this automatically added link there will be instantly connected to your meeting.And what is also interesting is that?Vintage wait both all the possibilities of Skype in terms of what was it take it certain put out too?To centralized exchanges between the various too, cool sequel that we have seen the the files, but now if you want to discuss.Uh around them these work truck plant workshop 3. Sanders work truck. You can set a meeting now or later again excess as much as you could you either the normal meeting in a room but you don't need a room you just see?Skype meeting create chance there is a link and now you can of course share you that stuff share window share PowerPoint on which people will be able to exchange. Even editing the document who editing the document with Skype, the meaning that you can improve.Communication in terms of reactivity because you can try example instantly create the Skype meeting because because also you know who is available or not due to the relationship between Scampi and and outlook.Work in Skype, you know who's available by just away unknown available first, but also because that's the same in outlook. So here you see that thread because I'm in a conference call.So I'm not free so instantly you know, people are available for instant messaging for a phone call with Skype video conference or whatever and if so, you can again send this Skype meetings online and people clicking on this range do they have if they have?Code or not they only need again browser Internet browser and are connected to the Internet to instantly join my meeting.Um that then we'll be able to wear again, I will be able to share.Uh my desktop the window. I will be able to instance invite more people and by more people. I also mean people from outside instantly. So a new way of communicating him again of sharing because you can share windows PowerPoint 52 author of this document we can see.Lots of possibilities with these groups uh intricately linked to outlook and Skype Lee to again after an improved communication more reactive in terms of of. We've seen that in Skype, you can show.Um so I will not see changes so at your disposal groups calendar.Find book and if you go from if you go into A.Online so if you go your mailbox online mailbox again, you will be able to create these groups also.Can you speak in the same with the street leasing people also from?So if you select online you see the same conversations calendar 5 notebook uhm.So she was number my fine time.Pussy propose different time for cheap.Why we boot on my undesa quest from the group to decide are fine time for Microsoft outlook so this? What is preferred so we can even said, yeah prefer? No other options? Don't like any of these times then options you can propose a new debt.Um cancels invitation show availability etc. So many possibilities again from this also.You can get more and you can even even there. This is not completely but you get even half a task scheduler. Um photo up of tests dedicated to the groups with planner and you can even have your own site.Get these whole site in SharePoint because they are officially if I you will be able to really share links information at the activity, so that that's where all this working group in share point.Swim.To really, really manager video?Group and bigger project, so long to compete with this working group.OK, that is one solution to face the different situations that you have again chair conversations calendar files. Newton connectors can you connect your poop to other social networks? I would say?So you can procedures connectors to keep current with content and updates of interest from other services featured spreadable even feed size jeans. Jitra so lot of possibilities coming with workgroups along with conversations calendar and storage file storage.But you will be able to share documents.If we go back to our.The situation, said one coordination of agreement out organize all the invoked Department where you have seen up to each other. Different applications out to organize interview video collaboration, according to their value EG well, I would just give you again this.That with the group you can.Exchange conversations or communicate you could have meetings.Uhm you can share documents.Anywhere in the world.The notebook and shit.Um.And.So that's the OneNote online so of course, it's based on my notes. Uh not taking it at your computer with office 2016, which can have it online so all the possibilities and of course, the site with with with which you are going to.Uh communicate, but on a much higher level than gamma group because you can add some site contains different pages, giving the of course, also information also you will have a recap.Uh every Portables then you have duties from members of after poop, you and share files. You can get organized well. Lots of things available in share point just by creating these working groups so.Very very important new way of communication of communicating with.With this working group where we have seen the Yammer groups there. We have seen Sky P to be able to know when to join people uhm at which time because their relationship with goofies when you're in calendar, even online.Go to 2 people, you can have in your mail when there is a mag usage. You see that trying to work is available. You can already send it so stages.Instantly you know who is available or not, and you can start a conversation with someone using again Skype again new way of communicating and sharing.Well, so hope.We have seen all the ways groups Skype Jammer SharePoint Access twice every so we have seen also should possibilities to in around human resources that we have to manage project whenever it is so thank you for.Your budget pension uhm and hope you like the best.Possibly, thank you.

Uses by job role: Assistant(s),"Hello everyone and welcome to thistraining session. So today, we're goingto see a training session aboutthe assistant job.So.To begin with, we have someinstructions. Turn off the call waiting if you're using yourmobile Phone to join this training session. Or else yourmusic on Hold will be out by all of the participants. Alsoremember to mute your microphone. If you havebackground noises around you please mute your microphone, sothat you do not disturb thetraining session. And also keep your screen active at all time,do not let your computer go into sleep mode or else you'll beautomatically disconnected from the training session and soyou'll have to log in once again to join us.So today, objective is to improve our efficiency indelegation and communication.So we have 45 minutes on 3 assistant use case scenarios.We're going to see Sharepoint, to create documents on thecollaborative space. Teams : to contact absent collaborators anorganize our contact by groups.Outlook : to manage and share thecalendar. OneNote : to organize our notes.World : to credit documents and we're going to usethe themes on PowerPoint.So let's go right now.First of all we have some, as we said just before, use cases. Sofirst of all,our issues right here. How do we get in formations and whattools do we have at our disposal in order to make remoteworking efficient, when we need to write a document at the lastminute. So the first tool that we are going to use today.His name : Sharepoint. To access SharePoint we need to go online. Up here we need to access the Office portal.portal.office.com to access it.In it, we are going to find our different applications as youcan see on my screen. We have Outlook, OneDrive, Word, etc,etc. All of them are accessible directly online. You do not haveto use the local software to access those different toolsbecause we have them alsoonline. So here I want to useSharepoint. What is Sharepoint ?Sharepoint is a shared collaborative space. Which meansthat we're going to have groups, SharePoint groups on it, and every members of the groupwill have an access to the different documents that we aregoing to share in it.So let's click on thatto see what it's all about.Here, when I click on the littleSharePoint icons. Well.I have on the screen a lot ofdifferent things. News fromsites. Frequent sites, following sites, recent sites, suggested sitesand also, as you can see on the bottom, featured links, recent documentsand save for later. We are not going to see all of that today.Let's just go right here. We have sites. So the frequent sitesare the one that, as the word said, I went not too long ago.""Following"", well, it's like putting a site in favorites, so here.We have little stars next to our sites name. If we go to ""Frequent""here. Here we have one site, if I click on the Little Star,""Follow""... It will now be in ""Following"" right here. I clickonce again on the star and it willbe not here.""Recent"", well, so when I went torecently. And ""Suggested"" : other one that I have access to, butI'm not going a lot on them. So they are suggested becausemaybe there are new informations, new documents, etc.Here, I already opened one of my Sharepoint sites asyou can send that up here. We are on ""Demonstrations"".This is a basic, a default SharePoint site right here.I did not add anything else except in the library, inthe document library. But here well, I will have access to mySharepoint site. As you can see in the far left : documents,services, activity, pages, etc, etc. So we have a lot of different things on Sharepoint.But what we want to use today is the document tab.In the document tab, as you can see,I already have a lot ofdocuments. If I want to, right here, I can click on the folder.And I'm right here, but I can also click on a document...And the document will open directly in the online version of Excel. How did I do to have those documents right here ?Well, on the top, you have different actions.New : I can create a new folder, a new document : Word, Excel,PowerPoint, OneNote, Forms... Even an Internet link... Directly fromSharePoint. I do not have, it isn't mandatory, to create the documentoffline and then upload it.I can directly create it online. So that's whatwe're going to do today.I'm going to create,let's say, a Word document.Here. I have my Word document that isstill opening and I can add information. ""This document isabout...""If I want to, I can use any of the tab that I also have on Wordoffline as you can see right here. ""Insert"", ""Layout"", ""References"", etc, etc. Word online is not the exact same as Word on mycomputer because, as you can see, we don't have exactly the same functionalities. We have much more functionalities in thelocal version, the software version, but this application isnot that bad. We nearly haveeverything. And I can use that to create my document directlyin SharePoint. No need once again to create it offline andupload it, etc. No! I can doeverything in here. How do I rename my document ? Quite easy ! I click on ""Document"" at the Top right here and I can change thename. So I will call it... ""Information 101"".I just click elsewhere, and as youcan see ""Information 101"".Anytime I had information, as you can see on the Top,we have ""Saving"". And if I stop writing ""Saved"". It's automatic.I do not haveto go into ""Files"" and ""Save"", ""Save under"", ""Save as"" etc, etc. No! Justevery time I add anything orremove anything. It will automatically save.I can close this document""Information 101"". I will reload my library right here.And if I go into my files... ""Information 101""... Right here.Modified a few seconds ago, of course, and modified by, and thisis my demo account.So...We have a solution to our problem... Well, one of our problembecause... OK, we can quickly create document online, etc... ButHow are my coworker going toedit it ? Well, quite simply as I said at the beginning, Sharepointis a collaborative space.As you can see on the Top right,w e have 4 members,in this team, in this SharePointsite. So, everyone of themwill be able to click on my document and to edit it.We can have...modification at the same time, which means I can open mydocument, my coworkers open the document as well, and both of uswill be on the document editing it.We'll see the little mouse cursors with colors,on them, with their names, etc. But also I can edit a document. As the next morning, a coworker edit the samedocument I will see some notification when I go back onit. So we will be able to work on the same documentat the same time quite quickly.Let's just imagine that we have a Powerpoint document. Let's say we have 4 slide to create.We have no slide for now.OK, I share my document to my coworkers. We are four. Everyone create his own slide.In a matter of minutes, the document is complete.So, if we go back on our PowerPoint...How to get information? What tools do youhave at our disposal to make remote working efficient? Well,we answered this question. How to get information? SharePoint. On Sharepoint, we need a file : it's already shared by coworkers. Wehave the files. No need to send a mail : ""Oh please, can you sendme a copy of this file"", and then the answer 10 minutes later, etc... No!Here, the files are in the same place, in SharePoint.I don't need to ask anyone. If the files is in here, I click onit, I have the information.And we want to work remotelyand efficiently. Well, as I just said, we go into SharePoint. Weopen the document. My coworkers opens the same documents at thesame time, and we can all work on the same document.So...How do we handle that ? As we said, we have SharePoint, with thepossibility to create a new document online and to find itback in the file library.Now we have a new issue.How to make up for the frequent absence of collaborators, toexchange information and have work instructions? What tools dowe have at our disposal to ensure that our mission is doneefficiently? How would we handle that? So...Now, we wantto exchange information and to have work instruction frompeople that are not on site. They are not here. They are not with me.How do we communicate?Well... We have 2 possibilities.The first that you're going tosee today is Teams.Teams, maybe you already know it,a little. Teams is an instant messagingapplication. As the name say, it will help us to quickly sendmessages. Let's begin with a little tour of the interface.On the far left,you will have different tabs.""Activity"": the activity feed well, you will find everynotification that you have on Teams. Someone tried to call you.Someone likes your message.Someone shared you a file.Every notification, information that you need.In ""Chat"", as a name say, it will be right here, the instantmessaging tab. You'll be able to chat, to exchange, with yourcoworkers in it, like you used to do on Skype for example.The ""Teams"" tab in Teams : well, here the ""Teams"" tab.We are not going to see that in details today. But this tabwill allow me to create what we call ""teams"". Those teams willcontain channels, discussion channels and, in those, I will beable to exchange informations, to send document, links,and work, collaborates, communicate, with my differentcoworkers.""Calendar"": in the calendar, I will find, well, as the name say it, mycalendar, so in it, you will, of course findevery meetings that you have, but there is something quite interesting with this calendar.In Teams, in the Team's calendar,every meeting that we can find is from Outlook.And in Outlook, every meeting that we can findcan be from Teams, because everything that you create onTeams, on the calendar of course, will automatically be added toyour Outlook calendar. And everything you add in yourOutlook calendar will be automatically added to yourTeam's calendar. So, there is an imbrication between the two of them, they worktogether, so that you do not have 2 different calendars, do youimagine the problematic here? Now we have only one calendarthat are shared between Teams and Outlook. Well, I think ""Calls"", you already know, but it's all aboutto call people.""Files"": in files you will find your recent files, your MicrosoftTeams files, the files you downloaded, and the files in yourOneDrive. And with the three little dots, well it's justto find applications. We are not going to go in detailsabout that today.Let's go back into ""Chat"". So into ""Chat"", we have 2 tabs on the Top.We have ""Recent"". ""Recent"": I talked to people recently, so well,as you might guess, those are our recent chat. As you can see here,for example, conversation tests : one in French that is ""Strategyreorganization"" and we have ""Project test"".So we have our different chat, our recent chat,that we can continue whenever we want, but most importantly, wehave ""Contacts"" on the Top.""Contacts"" is exactly what you think it is.In it, you would find different contact groupsthat we can create as you can see at the bottom,""Create a new contact group"".I will name it...""New York site"".Create.We have ""New York site"" right here. Three little dots.And we can add a contact to this group.So I had for example, Oliver I guess... Yeah, Oliver.OK let's had Oliver, and now Oliver is in the ""New York Site"" group. Here, as I just clicked on Oliver, as you cansee. Our conversation just appeared and something quiteinteresting. Here. As you can see I sent this message.Uh on the 12th of January.2018. It's been 2 full years.Because yes, Teams will remember your conversation. Yourconversation will not disappear when you close this window.Everything will remain directly in it.So, well, you can find every information that you need right here.What can we doon the Teams chat ? Well. Of course, we can send differentmessages. But we can add, we can enrich our conversation. As youcan change the bottom right here under my a text bar.I have different icons.The first one, I can format my text, put it in bold, italic,underline, etc, etc.I can set the delivery option : standard, important, urgent.I can send attached document.Add emojies, GIF, stickers, and evenscheduled meetings directly from a private, adirect conversation, between Oliver and I.So that's quite a lot of thingsthat we can do right here onTeams. That not all ! Because also we will havewhat we call ""the availability status"". We have some statutesright here on the left. As you can see we have Laurent Balardy, andOliver detects. Those ones have a little yellow circle right here.If I go in the Top right, I have my little picture. I click on that, and I can click here on ""Available"". I will see all of thedifferent availability statutesthat exist. ""Available"", as a name say, I'm available, you can talkto me, no problem.""Busy"". ""Busy"" means, well, I'm probably into something important. Some things that has all of my intention right now.So maybe I won't answer your messages. Maybe, I won'tever see them. ""Do not disturb"": ""Do not disturb"" is a bit special,because this one if you click on it, people of course, there will be able to send you messagescall you etc, etc. But,you will not receive any notification on that.No little pop up at the bottom of the screen that said thatsomeone sent you a message. No little noise that tells youthat you receive a notification. Nothing. We will be able to see all of them directly into Teams into the activitybutton, on the Top left, but ""Do not disturb"" as the name say I donot want to be disturbed.""Be right back"" and ""Appear away"" well, those are away fromkeyboard staches. So quite simply, I'm not in front of my computer, I won't answer right now. That's all.So, when we sent messages to our coworkers on Teams, as we saidjust before we can send documents. Something quiteinteresting is that at the Top we have different tabs. I won'tgo into much details about them. But we have the ""Files"" tab andhim here, I will fine everyfiles that I shared with Oliver. Here I didn't have shared any document,so I won't find them. But maybe I have some with other coworkers.Yeah, right here as you can seewith Pierre. I already shared a picture and so it's right here.I shared it,  as you can see, on the 16th of November 2017.So quite a long time ago, as well. And the currency is still here.I can access it. Pierre canaccess it. No problem with that.Now, that we saw...Teams, we havethe answer to let's say, 50% of our issue. OK, I can sendmessages, I can call them from Teams well, yeah, yeah. That'squite quick, quite simplebut... How can I doto know if a coworkers is available when for example, isalready in a call or in a meeting? How can I know if he'savailable in 30 minutes?Well, we're going to go on Outlook.In Outlook, let's go directly at the bottom left in the calendar.Here, as I said, we can find every of our meetings, and, by the way,let's create a meeting right here in Teams.I will create a meeting for the24th Friday. Hop!""Create meeting"". Let's just call it :""Test Meeting  Assistant""Right here, I will schedule it.OK, I close that. I go back on Outlook. I will reload... I don' even hadto reload, as you can see, right heren 24 Friday, we have ""Test Meeting Assistant"".OK, perfect everything is shared betweenTeams and Outlook.What do we want to know on Outlook? We want to know when areour coworkers available? Well.We can add their calendar to our own. Let's click on that.""From Address book"".I want to open the calendar of Laurent, I guess. Let's try Laurent.OK. Let's wait a minute and as you can see,we have Laurent's calendar next to mine, and every time I addsomeones calendar. They will appear on the left.I want to open Lisa's calendar.And even... Where is it ?... Pierre's calendar.Wow, that's quite a mess. I opened everyone calendar, but now, whatcan I do to have a better viewof all of that? Well, next to the name, we have a little arrows, pointing to the left. If we click on them...As you can see, our calendar on Top of each other.I have everyone meetings and informations on my screenright now and I know that we are all available right herefor example.We can click back on thosearrows to have them next to one another. And the little cross, to close everything. And I know that you're going to ask : ""But Thomas, we wereseeing what they were doing. I don't want to everyone in my companyto know what I'm doing every time at work!"". That's ,well... That's a problem of privacy right here!Well, we can share our calendar on the Top.And here when I share my calendar to someone... Let's share it to Laurent.Oh no, not ""Lamp Project"", I said ""Laurent""...Hop, right here...Laurent... Add... OK... I can choose different permissions.Laurent... Can he view when I'm busy ? It means that what he is going to seewhen he opens my calendar,he is going to see ""Amaury - Busy from 9 to 10"".That's all, nothing else.Can he view titles and the locations ? ""Amaury - not available from 9 to 10because he is in a HR Meeting,in a room 104"".Can view all details,well as the name say, Laurent will see everythingabout my different meetings.""Can edit"" : he will be able to edit what I have already created.And ""Delegate"", it would be able to do anything that hewants on my calendar, as if he was me.So you can choosewhat your colleagues are going to see. By default, you have...Let's remove Lisa...  You have my organization, which is everyone in the company without exceptions. And here youcan choose what they are going to see.""Can view when I'm busy"", ""Can view titles and locations"", etc, etc...So you chose, and, by default, it's ""Can view that I'm busy"". So, do not worry about your colleagues seeing everything in your calendar. So we saw two shared calendar. If we go back on our PowerPoint...How to make up for the frequent absence ofcollaborators on site, of course, and exchange informationand have work instructions?... Teams! The instant messaging of Teams.We need information: we call, we send messages, we havethe information right now.And also, if we want to know if a coworker is available, we open their calendar on Outlook, and so I'm able to see when theyare available or not.And so, what tools do we have at our disposal to ensure that our mission is done efficiently? Well...We already said that.So on Teams, the availability status that isvery, very important. If you send a message to someone in ""Be right back"" or ""Appear away"", of course, he's not going toanswer right now.And same thing for ""Do not disturb"" or ""Busy"" you need to use thoseavailability statutes to know, as the name say, when your coworkersare available or not.And also we had Outlook.Last use case.To format a document quickly. Issues: how to progress on theformatting of documents ? How to automate a layout andsave time? How to get tasks validated by managers ?OK, so first of all.We are going to check directly. Let's go back on the Officeportal by the way right here... Hop...Office portal. On the Office portal we are going to talkabout very important applications. Next to Sharepoint, by the way.""OneNote"": OneNote is exactly like your paper notebook thatyou have somewhere on your desk.So you will be able on OneNote to write everything, everywhere.You want to write something well. You write it when itwherever you want you can add pictures, you can add linksvideos. You can share with coworkers your OneNote.So here I will...As it concerns the left, I have here ""sections"". And, in the sections, I have pages.Let's create a new section. Let's call it :""Assistant notebook"".And in it, I can create pages so for example, ""Meeting"".And also create new pages and a new meeting, etc, etc, etc.So yeah, we can createas much pages as we want on OneNote and as I said, just beforewe can write wherever we want.I can select multiple informations.Hop... Right here.But also I can format  my text, you guess that, I canadd... Right here...as you can see, little icons.So for example, let's say: ""Call manager...Very important"". I can add a little icon next to it, I willhad the exclamation mark for example, just a little reminderwith a little drawing next to it. As you can see I can add quite a lot of them.I can insert tables,documents, images, links, record audio, add symbols, mathematics... Symbols as well, as you can see, right here;emojis, stickers, and even meeting details. If I want to, I can add meeting details from an Outlook meeting that I have.So of course I have to connect right here to add it. I won't dothat right here because that's not our training session case,but you can do that.Drawing as well, we can draw.Hop, directly... So quite quickly... Hop...This information is related to this one, this one to this one, etc, etc...Hop, I can remove that.We can change, also, how we can view our page.So yeah, it's really importantto use OneNote, and, personally, in my company, I use itevery time, because you can...Let's say ""filter"" this information how you want it to be filtered. You can have as many sections as you want, as manypages as you want.And you can put information wherever you wantand find it back quite quickly as well. So yeah, quite important to use OneNote.Let's close that.I'm going to open a Word document. Well, I'm going to opena Word document, but I could open a PowerPoint, an Excel, I could openany of the Office 365 document.The important things here... Let's put it on the screen.The important thing is that...I want to show you that on Office 365, we can share ourdocument. When we were on Sharepoint I was talking about: ""Yeah,every document is shared, everybody can go on it, edit it, etc.""Well. We can do that with any document that we want.On the Top right, as you can see right here, we have ""Share"".I click on it. I choose the OneDrive that I want to useit to share it because I can have multiple OneDrive, butjust one is quite enough, believe me. So here my document would benamed. Let's call it: ""To delete"". OK.We're going to wait a few second because it's loading the document into Onedrive, and then I'll be able to share it afterward.So just a few seconds.Here, I have a little window that just appeared withdifferent information. First of all, let's click on the firstsquare like this on the first window. Multiple possibilities:I want to share my document to: ""Anyone with the link"". With this option,this would create, of course, a sharing link.I can send this link to anybody in the whole world. They're will be ableto access my document, to edit my document etc. Be careful because anybody can share your link. You sent a link to someone,that sent it to someone, then to someone else, and at the end ofthe day, a 200 people have access to your document.So be careful with that.""People in your company with the link"".With that, well it's the exact same as theone before, except it will stop at your company walls.Everybody in the company would have access to the document, but not anyonein the outside of your company. ""People with existing access"":it's just to create, or regenerate, or refresh your sharing link with everyone that has already access to the document.""Specific people"", as the name say, you are going to sharedocuments with well specific people, that you choose andonly them will have access to it.You can also allows the editing of the document and if you do not allow it,you can even block the download of the document.I want to share my document with Lisa.Let's share it with... Dina for example, and thenwe've Olivier. OK. I can add a message: ""Here is the documentI was talking about"".And I have three options to send it. I can click on ""Send"". By doing that this will automaticallysend a mail with the showing link inside and the little messagethat I wrote : ""Here is the document I was talking about"".I can click on Outlook. This will open a new mail page,with the showing link inside, and I will be able towrite in this mail. And lastly, ""Copy link"": this would create alink that I can copy to sendit to anyone, with Teams for example. And it will be able by clicking on it, to access my document. When I re my document to someone as we said onSharepoint, they will be able to view it, to edit it, to evendelete some information in it, so be careful with who you share your document.But this could be quite usefulto work quickly on different things.And lastly, I'm going to open a Powerpoint document.OK, we have a Powerpoint document right here on the screen.What I want to talk about is the templates. What are the templates ? Well,you have themright here on the screen. As you can see, we have differenttemplates. I can click on ""See other"".Oh my Powerpoint that is opened just under it, is causing some trouble... OK.OK. All the templates and we have a lot of differenttemplates right here. Let's say. I want to use this one : ""Sector"".I can choose of course, the color. I want it in orangefor example. ""Create"".And here, when I insertnew slides, as you can see, all of them will have the same template. And so, I can just use that... so I I don't have to think of : ""OK, I need a templatewhat could be professional but not tooprofessional, because we are open minded etc."". Yeah, just go into the templates. Just when you open PowerPoint, they will askyou if you want a template.And so just like that, as you can see I have a whole template.So if we go back on our first Powerpoint right here.How to progress on the formatting of document? Howto automate a layout and save time? How to get task validatedby managers ? Well. OneNote, the sharing and the template. Everything.And, of course, those different applications are available onmobile as well so you can workreally anywhere at anytime.If you have any question related to what we saw today, please ask them right now.Oh, while  you are thinking about your questions, of course,here... This is what we saw today.I guess that everything about that is clear andthat you understand everything that we saw.If you do not have any question and don't hesitate to ask them, ifyou have any of them. I thank you for being here today. Ofcourse, make the best use of what you have learned and wewill see each other on another training session.

Uses by job role: Marketing and communication,"Welcome to the surface 365 training. The subject of this session is to have a look around Marketing and Communication; and in fact, to go over3 job situations that you may face if you are from the Marketing and Communication Department. So welcome to this session. My name is Charles BONACHERA and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. So what we will be discussing during this time, I've told you already: 3 job situationsthat you may face in marketing and communication. The first issue would be to try to keep yourself organized in your relationship with others, in any type of relationships. In fact, I will say that I will try to show you some solutions or two at least, that will help you stay organized.The second issue will be to to see how to prepare a big event.Also, having to use some tools prepared ahead of time, provided by Microsoft Office 365. And then the third issue will be to get the marketing plan in a very short time, so how to succeed in having a marketing planin a very quick and short time. So the goal of this session is to collaborate efficiently and get a better communication globally. So let's go...And for that, first I will open Outlook.To keep yourself organized in your relationship with others, you havedifferent possibilities; but the main one is the new opportunity in Office 365 and Office 2016, which is called groups. The groups. If you want to keep organizedand nevertheless, have relationships with others, you may try to create groups for that purpose. How can you conceive these? When you are in outlook, in the home tab you have... nearly at the end of the ribbon,a new section called ""Groups"" where you will be able to create a ""New Group"". So there you will go in the popup to give the new group a name. You will be able to decide whether this new group is public or not. Of course, it will dependon the purpose of the relationship that you want to have with the others, the other people: internally or externally. So let's say, it could be private so that you will decide whether to subscribe new members so that you see group conversationsin their inbox, private inbox also; otherwise, they only see them in the group inbox. So you will create a group. What is interesting in this is that in your mailbox at... in the folder pane, here on the left,the folder pane at the end, you get a new folder called groups where you find all the groups you are members of.And others, because you have created them or because you have been assigned to a group and invited to a group directly by someone else. If we have a look at this folder... I have already groups, so that's why I'm not creating one.But once you have created one, you see that of course, if I go to this ""Webcast"", there is one unread conversation. Here, I've got 2 conversations and here I've got 2 other conversations, which are not... which are still unread.OK uhm so in these groups what's interesting with groups is that in our subject, which is to keep organized in your relationship with others, the interesting thing is that for each group created,...each group created will instantly createthe conversation orthe equivalent of the mailbox where all the conversations of the group will be concentrated (focused). So here I have a new tab, which is called ""Home"" and this tabsynchronizes all the actions and commands that I can have with my group. So the first is the conversation. So it means that I can have a conversation with the group, OK? So I can have a new conversation, meaning that the conversationseen or sent by all the members and all the members of the group will receive my email, my message; and if I had subscribed the members, they will also receive a copy of this conversation in their own mailbox, in their own personal mailbox.By personal, I mean their professional individual mailbox; and also a copy in the group mailbox as pretty much said earlier, having here access to the mailbox of the group. To help you again keep organized.there is also work calendar which enables, regarding the group members, to invite them individually but through the group. So you may now recognize the Outlook interface you may know fromOutlook 2016. And you can have new appointments, new meeting requests... but each time, what is available, is that you see this is the group address.So that means that each timeyou have the possibility to send and create an appointment or meeting exactly as you would with one individual but pieces (attachments) directly sent to all members of the group. Then of course, you get all the functions of Outlook... which of course, youyou can insert documents, attach files... You can well do anything... Attach file here with the new functionalities of Outlook 2016 that I invite you to find in one of our MOOC training regarding using Outlook. Also, to get back to what we first saw...We have seen...For the groups, we have seen...the conversations, calendar, but there is also something very, very useful and that you may found very useful to again keep organized and have still a good relationship with your other members of groups and people that you want to keepupdated with the documents for example: Here, when you create a group within ""Conversations""/""Calendar"", there is also aspace, your own online storage where you can upload documents that can be shared by the group. So thisyeah, this file can be shared by all the members. From there, we'll be able again to share them with anyone outside your organization and outside Outlook. So you are notrestricted to your organization or to your group. This group functions are very, very interesting to keep again organized within your team or small groups.But that is not a restriction to these couple of members because from there, you can still share documents with people outside your organization, having in mind still security; So, you can copy a link to... a restricted link for example, to keep (maintain) securityor to send a few links or anything to someone external to your organization or invite both inside your organization and this time in this case you are directlyrelated to the organization, your organization book... address book. So that's another feature, which is very, very interesting in our issue, first issue to get organized and nevertheless, related to all members ofour group for instance; And the last option is the Notebook. Notebook is also a notebook so to get (take) quick notes that you will also share with the rest of the members of the group. So that's the main featurethat you may use in your organization. There is something else...If you go to outlook. There is also the possibility with Skype to know if people are available or not. So you can alsotake advantage of this Skype E which is included in Office 365 and in office 2016. For example: Here, one member of one of my groups, I know that his presence is unknown. But this means that if he were available at this time,I would...You see, like mine here, I would say I'm available and video capable. That means also that in my relationship with people I can instantly create for example, send them an instant message or have an audioconference or videoconference call. Well,pretty much do everything instantly. And that keeps me more organized more in touch and in open communication with the rest of my people. When I need to communicate effectively with the rest of my group, so that's the first answer and solutions tothe main... first issue, which was to keep yourself organized and nevertheless related to the others... Share with Outlook and Skype: conversations, calendar, files, notebooks; And to instantly see the availability of peopleand to encourage reactivity in terms of communication.That was the first issue.If I get back to my second issuewhich is to prepare a big event.So the questions at stake... How to manage the organization of an event with internal and external participants? How to give an attractive and creative dimension to a presentation? - which is part of this event. You have a presentation to deliver and how    to get an attractive and creative or more creative and attractive dimension to your presentation and how to centralize the exchange (of information) of all the participants. For this, there is something new in Office 365; this one is called Yammer.If we connect the Internet to Office 365 account online, you'll be greeted by this page; Unless you have changed it. But let's say that you haven't change it. So you will be welcomed in this page. And here you find, of course, all the applicationsthat you can access online; there are several ones of course. Your Mailbox, Calendar, People, PowerPoint, Excel and Word - which are the main applications that you can use and may use when you connect to the Internet. But there is something new here, which is called Yammer. So what isYammer? In fact, Yammer is a network, a kind of social network where you can... that you can use to again have conversations. So, for example, if I go to this network that I created: Marketing and Communication, you see that you can haveconversations. So you can see all new conversations. So it means that all this network can be used by also people participating in a project; like this one, to prepare a big event. And from there, you will be able to share conversations, but again files and notes.So it's not exactly... or it's also the creation of a new group; So, if you create a group... Here, create a new group at the bottom, left-bottom, ""Create a new group"". You can see also that can be either an internal group or an external group. So if you choose tohave external group that means that people from the outside world, I would say, that means outside your organization will be able to access this group and so share with you lots of information because this time contrarily to Groups where you could share a calendar,just conversations like messages, in fact, like in Outlook. Inside, you also have much more. It's a real network, social network... where you can again have conversations, but not only conversation because if you, let's say, you can share something with this groupSwhich is just: ""Hello, welcome.""And you can post it pretty much as you would with other networks, social networks; but you see also that you can have here a pollwith questions... That's very interesting if you have a decision to take and you want to let peoplewell take time sometimes to answer these questions; So, you don't need an answer instantly but you can ask a question. So,""That's my question"".OK and of course, you can get different answers, OK? So, ""Yes, perhaps, no, Don't know"".See, each time you get to the bottom of a question, you ask another one, OK?You see that this group is the recipient of this post, meaning that they will receive a postin their group calendar and in their mail. You can even add people to notify. So you can add people.And of course, you can add a document, so upload a file from your computer or a file from Yammer. Why from Yammer? Because as much as groups, here you have... Yeah. I haven't posted my message yet. So I post my message first.And now you see that people will receive the post, will be notified of this post and will be able to answer,And will be able to see the results. OK, and you can even change the vote. Here's the post. So something new, not directly available with groups as we have seen before. I was telling you that about files. So again pretty much as we had for the groups but share in this complete network.You see that you can also upload documents. The situation a little bit different because from there, you will not be able to share documents with the outside world. I mean, only with people inside network will be able to see this document.Of course, and you can even have some notes. Notes in this case, it is not the Notebook. It really, really creates a note. It is just also a simple note to (take) a quick note. It has nothing to do with the notebook, which is much more advanced in terms of writing a note.So,Again.In New conversations, you can have a pole, you can praise someone:""Thanks Paul for your job.""And the person that I want to praise.And now I can post this.And the system will look into the address book of the company.And the name that I have entered. But not only... So, you can see also on the right that there is a possibility to search information and things. You can directly edit information with a group.So you have lots of possibilities. The documents here are available. You can relate this group to another one.So if you have different group of people related not always directly involved in the same project but somehow related, you can subscribe to this group by email, post to this group by email. So it means that people will be able to... and you can have conversations in Yammer without everleaving your email inbox. So if you copy this, it means that you will be able from your mailbox to directly send post to this group, even if you're not connected to yammer! What is also interesting with this Yammer is that you and the group do not need to be on your computer.You don't need to be on your computer because this is an online feature an online applications, meaning that wherever you are, and on whatever the device, you have the possibility to use this Yammer. There is an application form for smartphones and tablets so that you can directlyconnect to this application from wherever you are, and whenever you want to. ... And of coursee, the rest of the group. And you can even see on the right, under the search bar the people already connected, look for someone have instant messaging with someone which is connected.And you can send message. Invite people or instant message with people which are online, and members or not of the group.So this is another solution to this part of this issue to prepare the event. So you have the possibility to create for each main event a new group, Yammer Group I mean, a new network. In fact, where you will be able againto share conversations files and much more possibilities for all people to get involved from anywhere at anytime. That was one of the first three...But now to give an attractive and creative dimension to a presentation that you have to deliver somewhere. If I go to. Um...There it is, sorry. Here's the presentation that I have created. Well, of course, you presentation would probably be much more attractive than this one. This one was done very quickly off a blank template... This is the result.Now just in terms of attractivity, if you go to ""Design"", you will have access already to some new templates to get instantlyOr with which will instantly see the results. So if you want to change thetemplate, this you already have at your disposal. Lots of templates that you can reuse instantly. Of course, if you change to anothertile, of course you will also get the results. So this was the Title slide, of course which is based on the template of title. So it reacts in a certain way, which is not always what you would get if you look at the normalslide. So you see that you can decide whether you prefer one or another, OK? And you can of course, reverse because I would like to tell you something. The first thing is that you can select a new thing with some varianceat each time to your presentation.And if you have for example here, a list of words or just at list that you want to present... If you goto the Home page and then format, first you can change to see just the ""WordArt Styles"", OK? But also,if you stay in the home tab, if you select your list, you will find in the middle of the ribbon something called ""Convert to SmartArt"" and there, you will be able to test another layout, another possible presentation to your list.And this may be of course quite interesting because you can get something much, much more attractive... So all are not, of course. That's it. But here for example, this one may be good. And each time, you can change to one that seems more presentable; This one for example.So, if we summarize... so if we go to design, you can change just the theme of yourpresentation first. And theneven for this list, if you go again to Home, you can convert this to and this time, each time PowerPoint will offer you of course, all this SmartArt based on the themes and that means the colors.And the font of the theme that you have chosen. So it might be a good way to have something more attractive, perhaps, then what you would have used at the beginning. So for example, then of course, the same if youhave inserted a chart into the slide Production...You see that each time you have something selected, there is a new tab, opening here ""Chart Tools"", for example. Here, for the chart... when you may find anotherlayout for your chart, a new style. And again, you may find something more attractive than just the chart you had at the beginning. So, many possibilities, always keeping the font and the color, basic color, OK?... of the theme you had.All right, so let's take this one, for example. Another way to get something more attractive.Then of course, you can insert a picture, the same each time that there is something you can convert to SmartArt. Just one thing, when you insert a picture.I will try this one first.So one.If you insert a picture.I will insert this one, for example.The system is able togive you here, design ideas. So the system when you insert a picture, the system will be able to show you different design ideas in terms of again design of the page. So you can, remember, you can insert pictures or even videos.So, search video online, video on your PC... So, here. And when you go to slide Show,you will be able to play video, OK? So it works. This is a Microsoft video. That also can give a much, much more attractive look to the presentation. And much more weight to the presentation and of course,the ideas you want to give to your audience. So again, each time there is a mix.You can again go to Home tab, you can then convert it to somethinbg more attractive, OK?To finish on that, just know that if you go to the Insert tab, you have at the far right... - we've seen how to insert a video - ...Just know that you can now insertan audio from your PC or even record your own sound. So now, I'm talking and of course, it is recording for the webcast. But it is also recording for the something inside the webcast. So if I close now you see that there is a media pic and if I click,I can hear my voice. Which is different that of the presentation of this webcast. So lots of possibilities! Even here: ""Screen Recording"" that we let you have something... you can select which part of the screen will be recorded andand everything that is on screen will be recorded and inserted into the slide. So, in 3 seconds... It will be recorded.So from now on, everything I do on screen, will be of course directly captured.Cool, I mean, all will be set online. So it means then that when Istop the video recording, you see this is...You can see this is inside the slide. You can then start it again at the bottom. There is here: play and pause. This video, which is in fact, recorded from your computer and what's on your screen. So lots of possibilities toimprove and make your presentation more attractive! So I would just edit this. You see that this was inserted into my slide. So remember when you click on Insert you will get here: video, audio and screen recording.So last possibility: How to centralize the exchange of all the participants. Well again, we see that groups possibility is to go to the groups here in the group's Calendar and Files central... Yammer, because in Yammer, it's a total network educated to project that poll and where people, again, share lots of information, communication and files. Again from there, so that's some of the issues that you may face. A lot more are available but of coursesome solutions that you can useto face the issue when you want to prepare a big event and after lots of people are involved both internally or externally; because again, the Yammer group can be external and that's people from the external world again, I would say.The last issue: How to draw a Marketing plan in a short time? How can you get for example, the collaborators ideas despite their distance? How to centralize the notes and documents of each and everyone involved? I think that we have already discussed that.So in this case you can face again this issue with either Yammer or Groups. How to gather everyone quickly and efficiency without effective presence? One of the solution that you may use isSkype E.Because with Skype E, you can instantly have...So if for example, you want to have an instant...I think with someone in Skype, you have your list of contacts that you have grouped... which are in groups or are organized by their status, but here you can instantly organize, shedule a meeting.So if you organize a meeting with someone means that you can instantly send invitation for everything to someone or even quicker;and more reactive: you can instantly for example start... So I'm the only one here for the moment. But anyone I think will instantly come along with me.In these.And I will send you.For example, or making could anybody again that receives this link with the instancing communication with me. So I can have an instant ink in quick quick meeting with anyone of my organization of course of my.The group that I intend to communicate with, but also with anyone outside and again, you can see that you can start a video neutral, which if you need to mute it, but you are an instant message here, so we can.Write message anybody to everybody you can and again, you can share your desktop or share window and even PowerPoint so if you want to share a PowerPoint I can will do second for example.So the system with.Load thePresentation you would be up to get the presentation to open go inside this conversation.So it takes just a human now this representation.2 numbers to all the against the participants in this session and everybody and even even.In the VM.On that presentation to the elbow 2 for example.Something and people at the end can even these 3 dots. We can even download boot plantation. The outlook presentation, which it's not double about point presentation in XPS format for from.At Microsoft, but instantly you can have a meeting with anyone inside your organization. Of course, but you can also copy Skype meeting options. You can copy a sorry you can.Reaching in folk you can.Keep this link or copy this change signage to everybody that you want. Anybody that you want again instantly be in communication in meeting with you. That means that can be someone from the external world external to your organization and that.And having your browser whatever browser is Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer. Whatever you can connect to this instant meeting and be discussing the problem for example, here.The plan that you can discuss dinner quick and short time, even inviting more people from the inside of your organization off again that we have seen with copying the meeting entry info to inverse someone from the external world.If you and you can so in a few seconds after Skype meeting OK or prepare a Skype meeting or share for example, from the 15th of February and that this particular time the meeting will start and people.Open Skype meeting instantly tan again. In fact, more and more people with a lot of possibilities. Instant messaging sharing desktop. The program or a PowerPoint presentation to be able to transform it to edit them together with other.People were so.Loving it so here we are at the end of this presentation around marketing and communication use cases I would say so. Thank you for attending this session hope it is used to and you can buy suppose and.Uhm I hope that you make the best use of these thank you and bye bye.",welcom surfac 365 train subject session look

Groups - Be more efficient with group working,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. This session is part of a topic called: ""Get started with Office"" and the session itself is called: “Be more efficient with Groups”. In fact, Working Groups that you can find in Outlook.We will soon discover all of this. Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. What are we going to discuss during this time? First of all, we're going to discover Working Groups, what they are and what they are constituted of, etc.How to create Groups afterwards, because you have to create a working group.Once created, we will see what you can do with the group, so you can use their features to work and communicate more efficiently from your desktop or online. At the end, we will see the Groups online, how you can access the Groups andaccess the different features and components of the Groups. The goal is to discover Groups communication features and hopefully that's what we're going to do during the next minute.First of all, what are Working Groups? They are groups that you create. When you need a group, you can create it instantly. Once you've created the group, the interesting thing is thatfor the whole group and all its members, there is a dedicated mailbox. With this mailbox, you willshare conversations within the group and the group can also access external email address. So that is the first thing, you share a mailbox with members of the group. Then we have a shared calendar where you will also share appointments, meetings,whatever item you want to create into the calendar, pretty much as you would do in Outlook. Then we will see that there is also a shared notebook that you can share with the various members, so that each member can edit the notebook and participate to its creation.Then we will have a quick overview of the planning tool, which is created each time the group is created and that's where you will be able not only to plan things as much as you would do with the calendar in terms of items,departments, meetings, etc., but in terms of staff dedicated and you will be able to follow the tasks that have been assigned to one or several members of the group. At the end, we will see that all of this is available also online. Working Groups are created on your Outlook 2016,on your computer, but it can also be created on the Outlook online. It can also be accessed from any place in the world, at any time, from any device because there is always the application created by Microsoft on tablets and smartphones.Let’s go and try to discover all this during the time range dedicated to products. Let's go to Outlook first.You probably know Outlook. Quickly, the interface: Each tab is dedicated to a topic and for each topic the ribbon below provides you withthe most common actions and commands dedicated to the task. So here the Home tab, Send/Receive, if you want to send and receive you have all the main commands at your disposal to send and receive anything in Outlook. The Folder, View, every time the ribbon adapts toyour needs, so it's a contextual ribbon, contextual commands are available each time. Then below left, all the accounts that you may find. Here I have several accounts.So they will appear here in what's called a folder pane. In the middle is the email folder with emails received for each account and on the right, the reading pane that shows the content of each email that you have selected.The purpose is to discover Groups. First, you have to go… You have different options. In fact, you can do that from the calendar accessible on the left bottompart of the screen with this icon. But even from the emails, you have in the Home tab at the far right Groups where you can find New Group.This button opens a pop up where you will have to choose a name for your group.Perhaps there is another one, and you see that the system automatically adapts the Group ID to fit the servers needsin terms of of identification and names. So this will be the group ID on the server. The Privacy: You have to decide whether the group is public, meaning that anyone your organization will be able to see what's inside the group or what the group shares inside the different features,or if it is private and, in this case,, only approved members can see what's inside. If you subscribe new members, it means that they will also receive the group conversations in their own inbox.Otherwise they will receive in the group inbox, so they will have to select the group inbox in Outlook to see the content of the conversation. Then we click on OK and we have to wait.This is the picture of the group. You will be able to edit it later. Now you can add people. We will see that you are the first member, the creator. So you are member, , automatically added to the to the group.And you can add more people.For example, my colleague trainer Amarra. I could continue looking for more people.Here we have at the moment 3 members and I could continue to add a lot of members. Description:“This is a group dedicated to…” and you explain what the group is dedicated to. Once you have created it, you say OK and the group is updated. Now the groups is instantly created with all the features that we're going to discover now. Still in Outlook, if you go to the Folder pane on the left, with all the accounts, I have created each from the ribbon directly.There's no need to select an account. You don't need to select, somehow if you have only one account the system will understand that it's in this organization that the group will be created. So you have to be connected to the account in the organization.At the bottom, you have Groups and you should click on More, it opens, and you see that we have “Webcast - Groups 2”. If you have several organization, which you might have but which isthe case for the normal, standard use. In your organization, just below your account, you find Groups and there you will find all the Groups you are member of or you have subscribed to and here we have our “Webcast - Groups 2”.You see that the page has adapted to your request and we will see that, now I have subscribed to this group, I see on the middle the list of all conversations and on the right, the content of the selected conversation.It will open on the right. Each time you create a group, we have this welcome message that says with the group you can start a conversation, view group files and activity, use the calendar, connect your apps, etc.On the left, all the conversations dedicated to the group, sent by the group or to the group. In the ribbon Home, be careful it’s a new window that is open and in this window there is only one tab called Home,you will be able to start a new conversation, a bubble group and the recipient of the email will be the “Webcast – Groups 2”, so it means all the group and all members of the group. You can add new items: E-mail Message,appointment, meeting. It means that somehow, the Groups are managing the calendar and you find it in the ribbon.Membership: You will unsubscribe. Add Members: You can add members to this group of personsdirectly from there once the group is created. You can Edit Group: Change the name, add a description, add people, change the language for the group.If you want people to send emails to the group, don't forget to take check this box so that people can access your group. We have a button called Calendar.It is strictly and completely dedicated to this group, so if you create new appointment, it will be directly sent to the group.All members of the group will receive this appointment and you have the possibility to use all the features of Outlook like the Scheduling Assistant, the possibility to have a recurrence, to categorized, insert an attachment file.All the features of Outlook are available, you can even have a Skype meeting with this calendar.In terms of view, you can ask for the day, the work week, schedule, etc. So it means that the calendar is totally and completely available for all members of the group.It’s a way to share one group without having to specify each time who is a member or which audience will be contacted. It's just opening this calendar, will send an invitation to all the members of the group.From the calendar you can also create another group. In case you want to subscribe to group of Groups to see and have Groups.In Outlook you see Calendar and you can also see Files. Each group createdfrom Outlook has a sharing space dedicated to documents where you will be able to upload files or folders exactly as you would with your personal OneDrive oryour business OneDrive in your organization. You see that you can upload a document and, as all members have access to this space, they are now able see the document.You have a mail messaging service, you've got a calendar dedicated to the group and you've got a shared space to upload documents, meaning that these documents are available anywhereand from any device, you just need an Internet connection. So that's the opportunity to go on the space dedicated to the group.Always available with Outlook whatever the version you use. If you go to the account of your organization, you have all the groups that you are a member of.Files, a dedicated space, notebook. There is also a notebook online that the group will share together. It's based on OneNote online and you have the possibility to create a section nameand a page to share information.You can use all the features of OneNote, to insert a picture, pictures online, a file printout, a link, whatever.It means that you’ve got all the same features that you have with Outlook or with Office 365 on a common way, you can use it but dedicated to the group. This way, the group is sharing a conversation, emails with the inside or the outside.You have a file system to share, documents, OneDrive, dedicated to the group. It's in SharePoint but it’sthe same way of working as on OneDrive, so you can get a link, share, etc. And you have a notebook that you can share with the group.There is a version on the web. Here we are or coming from our desktop Outlook 2016, so we have been automatically connected to the online version.But if you need to access the group from the outside of Office, remotely, from any computer or any device,you only need an Internet connection and you just need to enter in the address bar of any browser “portal.office.com” and you will be connected to this pagewith the welcome message and you will have, from the start menu online, the possibility to select the options.You will be arriving once connected with all the applications available for you and by your company. If you click on Mail on the left, you get Outlook.You see the groups and have access to the Groups in the same manner as with Outlook 2016. You have the list of conversations and have access to the calendar.In the groups that you want to see, we will see different groups.And here is the Webcast – Groups 2. That's the content of your group, here is the list, on the left, of all Groups. If you select, they are added and you can place them. You see that there are different colors. So webcast group is available and you can even create a calendar event,an email message.From online, from anywhere in the world, at any time, you can access your calendar.Office 365 will bring you to the welcome page. But there is also the application launcher. You can go to SharePoint, OneDrive. If you select Mail,from Outlook, select Groups and you can access the files or notebook.Even Planner.In Files,you will see the files that I have uploaded. Notebook, the notes that I have created a few minutes ago and here you have even a planning tool, which is called Planner.Where you can very easilycreate a task and assign a task to someone in the group. So you have All plans, you see Webcast -Groups 2. Let's go.So that's Webcast – Groups 2 and you see Add task, so you can add a task with a task name. You can select To do,and set a due date, next week for example.When you add a task for the plans.And you can select a bucket, which kind of task it is, it is not started, so that you can follow. The start date, today, it could be in tomorrow. The due date, let’s say it’s the 13th. Add an item if we need to add something to mark complete.The description of the task.Attach a file if you need and write a message and post it.Add assignment, so you assign a task to someone.To Amarra Mazouni, we have the task which will be marked complete by Amarra when she is finished. Here you have the Board.The Charts.It shows you the progress, here we have one task left, who is in charge. On the right you can group by or no grouping all the tasks. So you can see the tasks that are not started, in progress, completed.You can go back to mark if a task is complete. If we go to the Charts, there is no task left.On the right we see that the task has been completed. So it's very easy for you in a group to get Planner which is created instantly as soon as the group is created.The plan is created along. You can create new tasks and assign tasks to members of the group.So that's how you can easily access your group features from anywhere. When you're on Planner, if you go to the application launcher, you can go back to the Mail, Calendar and get more applications that you may find and in discover in another MOOC training, for example, Yammer, which is a perfect complement to a group.So that's what I could show you regarding the Groups. I've shown you all the features and how to be more efficient with Groups in terms of communication with features which are available from Outlook or Outlook online if you want to communicatewith a group of people.

Outlook 2016 - Optimize your organization,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. The main topic of these trainings is to get started with Office and more specifically, today we're going to see how to optimize your organization in Microsoft Outlook.Welcome to this session my name is Charles Bonachera and we are going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. What are we going to discuss during this time period? Here is the plan of the session. We will see how to organize first the view,what you see in your emailbox, the layout and what you prefer to see first or enhanced or highlighted in your emailbox. Then we will see the folders, how to create a folder and how to move a email to a specific folder.Then we will have a closer look to the categories and how they are activated in Outlook, how you can assign a major category and how you can change or create categories. At the end, we will see how you can have a follow-upon emails, to decide, to manage, to handle it, to treat it later on in the same day, the next day or the next week. The objectives of this session are mainly to discover how Outlook 2016can help you to keep your emailbox cleanly organized. Let's go to Outlook.Here is Outlook and that’s the view that you will be get on the first access to the Outlook application.That's exactly the standard view.In the upper part, the tabs that give you access to a lot of commands that are grouped in the ribbon, the ribbon being this part with many icons giving access to commands.If you change the tab, the ribbon changes and adapts to what you are supposed to need for the action in this tab. Here for example, in the Folder tab, I have the main commands that I need tohave an action on folders. Back to the Home tab. That's where you will get the first time that you connect to Outlook. So we've seen the tabs, the ribbon. On the left we see the Folder Panewith all the folders related to your account. Here there are many accounts but let's say that you get only one account. In the middle, the list of incoming emails filtered by the newest on top andthe oldest at the bottom. On the right, the Reading Panewhere you can see the content of an email once you have selected it.The first thing that you can organize is your view.By default, you'll get this one, but you can change it very easily by going to the View tab and there you'll get access to the main actions related to the view. For example here in the layout group,you will get a button regarding the Folder Pane. We will see that the Folder Pane is supposed to be normal and we'll have favorites displayed on the Folder Pane. If you want to have it minimized, just select Minimized. We can even turn it offso you don't have any access to your folders, and you can put it back.In terms of Reading Pane, it is by default on the right but you can request it to be at the bottomor you can turn it off. If you open an email and there is no Reading Pane, you will need to open with a double-click and at new pop up window will appear with the content of the email.The To-Do Bar is related to the other modules of Outlook. The first one is the Calendar that will open on the right of the screen.With all the meetings, appointments or events in your Calendar for the next 7 days. You can close it with the cross or on the bar you can activate or deactivate the calendar.Next, you open search fields to search for people, for example.I can look for Amarra and I find my colleague.Lastly, you can open the tasks. On the right you will get the list of all that you have to do for different dates. Here we have no dates defined for emails and in this case, you have all emails with no date.Here is what you have to treat, to manage today.And if you double-click, you open the related email and the following week. So I will show you how to assign a follow-up of an email in a few minutes.I will get back to the standard view, Reading Pane on the right.And my list in the middle.If you look at the list, you'll see that there is not only one email. But if you go up in the Message Preview you see that it is off. But you can ask for 1, 2 or 3 lines. If you ask for 3 lines in this folder, you see thateach email with a preview with the 3 first lines of the email itself. You can turn it off for this folder, you see that it could be done for all the inboxes in caseyou have lots of inboxes. The list will show differently depending on the size that you assigned to the list.If you resize it, you see that the layout changes and you have all the columns available instead of just a few ones: All, Unread, Mentions, the order is by date and a second order, the newest on top.If you  increase the size of the list, you get columnswith all the available information. I'll get back to normal and show you how to change the layout. Here it is ordered by date; If you click on this little arrow,you’ll get a menu where you can select a new order. For example, you can ask forthe sender. You can see that the list has changed and is organized by sender. Here I have all the emails sent by Pierre, another sender, and another one.To have things more defined, you can select an order. You cannot ask to show the emails the groups and now you've got groups created for each sender.And if you wish you are stillnot completely satisfied with this solution, you can right-click on the header and you see that you can collapse emails and in this case,all the emails from the sender appear and you can have many emails in one group. You can see that all the groups where emails are unread appear in boldwith a number of emails which are still to be treated. If you click on Unread, you get the same grouping by senders but in this case, only the unless groups will appear in bold,with the number of unread emails. Many layouts are available for you to change your preferences the view of emails.If I click on Date and uncheck Show in Groups, I have it organized by date with the newest on top and the oldest at the bottom. That’s the first thing that you can do with the View. One last perhaps: By default, emails arrivewith the oldest at the bottom and the newest on top, but you can ask to show them as conversations. If you click on Show as Conversations, each time there has been a conversationbetween you and a sender or you and a recipient, emails are grouped so that the same subject will lead to the group conversation, meaning that this conversation was originatedwith the response and a counter response, etc. When the subject does not change, it is considered the same conversation and you can group the group as a conversation.If you uncheck this box, the email list gets back to normal and you have the same standard view as at the beginning. This is what you can do regarding the view of your emails and the organization under View. Everything is under the View tab to organize it as you prefer.The other thing that you can do is create folders. In your account, in your mailbox, you can right-click and ask for a new folder.Give it a name.The folder come in alphabetical order. It appears at the bottom because of the W but first it appears underneath the name of the account. Once you've pressed the key enter on the keyboard,it goes directly in the list in the alphabetical order.The folder has been created, it's empty, and if you want to move an email to this folder, you have to right-click (in Outlook and in all of Office 365, the right-click gives you access to lots of actions relate to the context menu).It changes, if you right-click in the Folder Pane, the menu is not the same as on the email. So, if you want to move an email to the Webcast folder that I have just created, right-click on an email and Move and you see thatyou have all the folders of all your inboxes in the whole Outlook. Then you can decide where to send your email. If I click on Webcast, I've got my email here, which has been moved manually to the place I wanted,the folder I have just created. You can also drag and drop.If I open it, I have 2 emails: One that I've moved with right-click and the other one that I've moved with a drag and drop.You can select and move back to another folder or to the inbox.Now you have your emails. You see that you can just delete a folder once you have used it.In terms of organization,you can have a category assigned to an email. Right-click and in the middle of the menu you'll find Categorize. By default, the category are color category. The blue category is a standard category.There is a red category, purple, yellow, but each category can be changed in terms of name. If you click on All Categories, you see the available categories and you can rename each category. For example, in terms of projects.Now you see that my email in the list appears in red.In the Reading Pane, you can see that just above the content of the email the red bar appears with the name of the category.Interesting to see that you can apply different categories to an email. There is a drop-down menu to select a category.If you increase, you see the categories.If your layout is this, the order is no longer available directly so you should right-click on a colum, Arrange by and you get the same menu I showed you before.So you can also organize by categories here.If you arrange it in groups, you can right-click and collapse all groups and now you have all your categories. This is another way to organize the view in terms of organization. All your emails are organized regarding the category.All blue categories are here.Right-click on a column header, Date and Show in Groups. Then you can close or resize.The last thing that we can dois to organize a little bit your inbox. You can assign a follow-up to an email. Right-click and after Categorize you find Follow Up. You can assign a follow-up today, tomorrow, this week or next week.If you click on This week, there's a new flag that appears in the email.If you increase there is a specific column for that. And if you ask the To-Do bar and Tasks, at the right Next Week, get the report completed, you get the email in the list available for you to have an action on this emailand perform what was requested from you on this email.This way, you haveall the tasks they once completed. Click on the flag and the task appears as complete. It's a way to see exactly that this email needed at a certain point to be followed up, and now the action is completed.and it's closed, that no action is required now.You can close the taskbar to get back to normal. This was an overview of the few things that you can perform quickly to organize your inbox. Other things are available, a little more advanced.To go further, you have the MOOC training to find other MOOC trainings. Thank you for attending this session, and I hope you will make the best use of this. Thank you very much.

Planner - Follow the tasks of his team on a daily basis,"Hello and Welcome to this new Office 365 training. This training session is part of the topic Get Started with Office. The session itself is with Planner, the application is available from Office 365 and the exact title isPlanner - Follow the Daily Tasks of a Team. We will discover how to follow the daily tasks of a team using the Planner application and all its features which are quite importan. So Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we are going to spend the next30 to 45 minutes together.What are we going to study? Here is the plan. First, we are going to see what Cloud computing is. Then we see how to login to Office 365 because Planner is part of Office 365. We will also see working Groups and Planner because they are closely related.Then we will see how to create and assign a task with Planner and we will see how to follow up all tasks with the application Planner and all the features which are around this application. The goal of this session is to be able tofollow the tasks of a group or a team or at least to discover how to follow the tasks of a group or a team, using Planner. Cloud computing, What is it? In fact, you probably know Microsoft Office on your computerif you installed all the applications of today's Microsoft Office suite. Now we need the 2016 version minimum. It comes with Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook and OneNote when it is installed on your computer.You can have the same applications in Office 365 and this time it is available online.You can have access to Exchange Server, which is a server delivering mail for the Office 365 suite. With this access, you will be able to retrieve mails using Outlook on your computer or online because now it's available online;SharePoint where you share documents with your colleagues internally in your organization but it will be safe from the rest of the world; And Lync, which is not called Skype, which is a conference calls application and where you can havehigh definition videos using a webcam that you have on laptop or in a desktop. The interesting things with cloud computing with Office 365 is that, along with the applicationinstalled on your computer, there are nowOffice web applications which are available and are setup to be able to fit the exact screen, for example, of a tablet. So you have web applications available, which are also Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.On your smartphone, there are also Office mobile applications, Outlook for example, but also Word. All the Office suite is available on your mobile, be it your Android mobileor an iPhone from Apple. With Office 365 online, you have complete access whenever you want, wherever you are because it's available only with an Internet connection with any device.It's very powerful and helpful to have these applications available 24/7 wherever you are. You only need a device and an Internet connection. The compatibility is complete with the Office desktop applicationsbecause Office 365 is built by the same company Microsoft builts its desktop so there is total compatibility between the application that you access or that you may access online or on your computer.Security: It is secured. You need a connection to be connected to Office 365 online. Serenity because you can work if needed, when needed, anywhere and at any time.Let's see how to connect to the web from anywhere.You only need to enter in the address bar of any browser, Internet Explorer or Microsoft edge if you work with Windows 10, portal.office.com.You will be connected to this space which is the welcome page of Office 365, with all your applications that are available in the Office 365 suite: Mail, Calendar and all the rest of the applications that I've mentioned already Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.Wherever you are you can always go and find the another applications with the application launcher, which is kind of a start menu online that will give you access to all that list that we have seen previously.Groups and Planner.So let's go online. Let's go to the welcome page.You are welcome in Office 365, you are connected to your organization using your email address and your Office passwordthat you use by default and standard on your computer at your organization. So you have all applications and we are here to discover Planner and you see that here is the tile to access Planner.Even if you are on another application for example, in the mail, you still have access to the launcher. And here again, you find Planner.Let's go to Planner: Here is the interface of Planner. We see here it's Planner. Here in the Planner hub,that's where you get all your plans. By plan, we mean all the planningsthat you may have, the dedicated groups. Here you see your tasks. I have 4 tasks and if I click here I see all my tasks that might come from different plans.This is a group: Webcast, migration. This is Essencia Formation SNCF, etc. So I can see all my tasks, even the completed one.In progress, not started yet or completed. When you arrive on the Planner homepage, you get access to the Planner hub with all your plants and I click on a plan to enter into the plan of migration.For example, you can put your plans in favorite, but you have the list of all plans. So there is a double navigation on the left pane and here on the homepage of Planner. You've got the list of all your groups.Then you have the button to create a new plan. When you have a project or something you have to share with a group or a team and you want to follow the tasks that are delegated or assigned to members of the group,what is important to understand is that each time you create a new plan, like I'm going to do now, a group is created. There is a specific MOOC training on groups that you can also follow,explaining how you can be more efficient with groups. Each time you create a plan, you have to create a group, so it's impossible to have a plan without a group. When you go to your Outlook and create a group,either you use Planner or not, but you can have a group without using Planner, but it is impossible to have a plan, to use Planner without a group. So if I request a new plan and give a name to my plan,Webcast - Planner for example, the plan email address would be webcast-planner@yourorganization. You can decide whether the group is public or not.Public means anybody will be able to see what's inside the group. Otherwise people will have to request access to your group and you have to be part of the group to see the information and give a description of the group/plan.I've requested a plan so we have a group and I will be able to follow up. If I click on Create Plan, there will be a new plan, which is in fact a plan and a group. I again propose you to follow the MOOC Office 365 training on groups to see how it works.We are going to see a few things about the way Office 365 proposes you to share information with emails, conversations, calendar, notebook for each group, calendar and files.I am on Webcast Planner. This is my plan. I am still in Planner, so this is my plan. But if you go here and click on the 3 dots, you see that you will go to the calendar of this group.You will see the members of the group, you can see the files members shared and the notebook which is also created when you ask and request a new plan. So here we are in the part of Plannerdedicated to the Webcast - Planner group and we are going to see how we can use this application to follow the tasks of a group. The board is where you will be able to create tasks.The Charts is a view of the follow up of all the tasks. So no tasks left, unassigned, no tasks have been created. If you want to create a task you go to BoardYou have the possibility to create a new task. So to give a task,call the client for example, it is a to-do task for the moment and you can add a due date.For example, the 1st of March. If you add a task, here it is now.If you click on this task, you will be able to assign tasks to someone.I have found a name which is not member.So I have assigned the task to my colleague. The bucket is a to do task. It is not started yet. The start date will be tomorrow and the due date, March, 2nd.I can check this if I want to mark it complete now, which would be quite stupid.The description of the task:The client has to be called.You can even attach a file, browse SharePoint to find a file online, from a SharePoint in the SharePoint of your company for example, or upload a file from your own computer.It takes a few seconds for the file to be attached and uploaded. You can add comments.Please, Amarra, call the client.And if you post,it is posted and if you quitthere is now a new task that has just been assigned to Amarra and we will be informed if she has a new task. I could have gone directly in Members.I could have added Amarra before all of this by opening Outlook because people get the request in Outlook. I told you about another training on Groupsbut it's on Outlook 2016 that you can create groups or from here. I am on Outlook online and I click on Add members. Here you have people from the same company who come with nothing, and guests are people from outside with this symbol, meaning it's someoneoutside your organization.So now she's a member of my group and I remind you that my group is because I have requested this Planner and by pre-requesting and creating a Planner, there is a group created and now there is a group that can share conversations, calendar, files, a notebook.I go back to Planner to have a follow-up of my tasks. So it's very easy when you connect your to Office 365.Get to Planner and select users listand guests will be able to follow all the tasks, create new tasks: Get technical data.I add a task and I can assign it to my colleagues.  I can even set a label ""Project"".I can instantly know to which project the task is related for example, or any other category that you would attribute to this task.So now I have a new task and if I go to charts, I will be able to seethat there are two tasks left that you can group here: No grouping or Assigned to. In this case, I have all the tasks assigned to me and to my colleague. If I go to the tasks, I will be able to mark the task as completed and it disappeared. If I go to Charts, there is only one task left assigned to Amarra.I can see the completed task, which appears here.If I go to my inbox in Outlook, I've joined the webcast and here I have called the client.I can see my tasks. I received emails and I can go to Planner to follow my tasks or my colleague's.Here is how you can instantly create a plan. With this plan comes a group, which is mandatory. You can have a group with no plans defined, but you cannot have a plan without a group, so each time you create a plan, you have a group and again, you will be ableto share conversations, calendar, members, files, notebook and I propose you to follow the MOOC training about groups.Here is what I could say about Planner.So thanks for attending this session, hope you can can make the best use of it.

PowerPoint - Save time with themes and templates,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. This session is part of a big topic called “Get started with Office”. The subject of this session is to discover how to save time with the themes and templates provided by Microsoft PowerPoint.Welcome to this session. My name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. Let's look at the agenda, the plan of this session.We will see the difference of creating a presentation from scratch versus using a template. Then we will see that you can change the template once you have chosen one.We will also see how we can use different themes that are provided by Microsoft PowerPoint once you have started your presentation creation process. We will see that you can modify a theme and at the end of course will see how to save a theme before you save the whole presentation.The goal of this session is to help you save time in the creation process and at the same time try to increase the efficiency of your presentations. So, let's start and we start with PowerPoint.If you start from scratch the first time you open PowerPoint,you arrive on this page where you can understand easily that you have at your disposal different templates with different names.And these are templates that you can use to create your own presentation. But if you prefer you can directly go to the blank presentation to start from scratch. Your presentations are different and here for example,the pages are white, blank. Understand that we can teach you how to add a title so let's create a title, a simple one.Below it, click to add subtitle.It’s easy to understand, this slide is based on a standard template even if it's a plan. If we go to View and ask to see the slide master, will see that this is the master title.If we close, we can see that is the title slide. But you can see nothing is formatted.Just put a title, a subtitle and that's all. Now you ask for a new slide, either in the ribbon or with the right click in the navigation pane to add a new slide which is based on this slide,with the title and content and you see that they are different. But they are still blank pages. You can add a title and text.You have to do everything on your own.It means that in another slide you can ask for a new slide. You can change the layout, for example, with just title and see that there is nothing but the title. This is a totally and completely blank presentation.You nevertheless can insert pictures for example.Then if you look at the right you see that there are already a kind of theme or template because here it's a new thing in PowerPoint 2016to help you in the design of slides. When you insert a picture, you can choose the layout for this page. So here for example, this is the design, we can change it and adapt it to your own preferences and needs.So that's the first possibility, the first glance of what would be a template.What is available to you is you can add Quick Styles. These are not themes or templates but you can see that you can instantly change the style of shape.And you can adapt, but it is very simple and you still have to change the colors on your own.But it's really a complete creation from scratch. The interesting thing is that you can do whatever you like and whatever you fancy and what you prefer to do, but in terms of quickness in terms of efficiency the result will be what it will be.Another way is to select in the Design, we can see that there is already the possibility to change the template.It keeps what you have already created.But it adapts to the templates that are existing.That’s the first possibility to use a template, lots of templates are available. Now, if you prefer to directly start with a template, you may choose from the template.Why not for example, we start with this one and you see that there are variants in terms of color,in terms of background, different things but still keeping the same template so if you decide to create from this template, you can use a quicker aspect theme.But if you start to create, everything is adapted to the layout. Here you see that there is a title.Everything is created so if you want to ask for a new slide, the template is kept so everything is adapted and you can still select a picture.The system will propose you design ideas based on the same template. You see it has adapted the colors and the background. Even the font has changed.This is the first possibility. Here, you can select the layout.There are other opportunities. If you want, for example, to insert a chart.It will automatically adapt, but if you look at the ribbon you see that the chart can be changed.From there, you can instantly start changing the style of the chart and that's the real good thing.This is the part of the chart’s title, but if we go back to our title slide, if we go to Design, we can find the templates and you can change the template and have an instant overview of the result.Even for the other page.It’s instantly changing so you can instantly decide whether you want to change the template or not. But even so, if you select a template,you can at any time change the template and you see the variants are available here. Another thing: If you work for a new slide it will take the same template and you see that the background has changed.If you insert a chart, you can change the colors of the template. But depending on what you want to do with the presentation, if the purpose is to give information,to give ideas, to promote ideas, strategies, to make a message go through a presentation, you have the possibility to select SmartArt Graphics, which will help you in the creation of your slides.They're all grouped. If you want to have a list of possibilities…If I select these parts and go to the home to convert to SmartArt, I can change directly and have a new theme.Or a new SmartArt. So, first possibility: You can adapt the SmartArts. If you want more SmartArts, if you want to describe the process, you would perhaps add a SmartArt graphic or a cycle, you can change it.Hierarchy, relationship, etc. So, you can directly use it without having to create it, of course you could do that on your own, but it would take pretty much more time and with a result which would perhaps be better.Anyway, in terms of times it would be much more different. So here for example, interesting if you select this one, you can open here, and you can enter a new one.So very interesting to try to use already created SmartArts. In terms of design,we have seen that the design has changed. You can change the design; you see that your SmartArt instantly adapted to the situation.With Quick Styles you can change in terms of colors, but if you select your SmartArt, you can change the Quick Style, the theme style. It's very one by one. But if you go to the Design, in the SmartArt, you can change style and see the result of changing the layout.So, you will have to adapt to what you need but you see that if you keep the SmartArts, you can change not only the colors but the background of each form.You see everything is changing. So easily you can get your own needs and preferences.The same here, it converts to SmartArts directly.It’s really interesting to use this kind of thing. Once you have got the design, you can change the complete colors using the theme basic colors that are present in the themes,but you also have different options, so it's very in a few clicks to select but first should again fit your needs, your preferences, colors, themes and templates that will highlight and give more power to your ideas and the content of your slides.Exactly as it did here for the design, you can change instantly and give something totally different.Each time it is very easy and interesting to use design to change the font of the theme. It is very powerful.And you can if you want in a few clicks, whatever you do, you have the same template and you can reuse it all the time. So, it's very easy to change the text field, effects using the SmartArt tools in terms of design, template format, shape fill, shape outline, text field, text outline. Everything can be changed now that you have selected a theme or a template.In a few clicks you can change and completely adapt the content of your presentation. If you have for example, selected something which fits your needs in terms of the organization, your objectives orif you want to reuse this template for the next presentation to keep the same layout, the same colors or forms or format shapes, etc.,you can go in the Design tab in the Themes group. If you select, you get all the list of presentations with Custom presentation, the Office which are provided by default by the system. You can save the current theme. I've already saved other themes.You’ll see the themes I've been updated and now if you open it, you see that in my Custom you have different themes and templates that you can.These are the ones I used before. It means that you can have your own templates, select one orcreate your own template from scratch, which is still possible. I think this is a very good opportunity to save a lot of time and get a more powerful presentation.You can have your ideas better presented and better understood by your audienceand people that will see this presentation.These are the possibilities, now you just have to save your presentation.Either online using the different features and spaces available online with Office 365 or on your. Once you have saved you will see that you can reuse this theme as many times as you want in the Custom part.The first ones, this one is organic but this one is a true theme that I saved. This one, the second, the third and the last one that we did together.In the last arrow we have got everything, Custom and standard, the very first templates and themes will be your own ones.This is the end.I can close that.Here is my current presentation.Thanks for attending, make the best use of it and bye bye.",welcom offic 365 train session part big topic call get start offic subject session

OneNote 2016 - Discover the notes tool,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. This session is part of a bigger topic called: “Get started with Office”. The goal of this session is to discover Microsoft's note-taking tool, which is called OneNote which you may already know.Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next roughly 30 minutes together. What will we be discussing during this period? We will see how to change and organize notes with this application, we will see how to share notes with someone else from your own organizationor even outside if you take advantage of the other applications of the Office 365 suite. And then at the end, we will have a lo at the online version of OneNote,which is  one of the Office 365 online applications. The objectives of this session are mainly to discover the way to create, centralize and share all your notes. Then to discover the advantages of OneNote and how to use it effectively.So let’s go to OneNote.I will open it now.If it’s the very first time that you open OneNote, you may arrive to something called Quick Notes. Here it is in French but the rest of the interface is in English, probably because I've changed languages many, Spanish, French, English.What you may very well understand is that these Quick Notes, on the very first time you connect to OneNote,  explains the relationship that you can find between OneNote on a computer and a paper notebo that you may have already written.So it explains how OneNote can be used at work at the office, at home  to plan a camping trip, to buy any device, or at school.To take notes during courses, etc. So OneNote can be used anywhere, and the purpose of OneNote is to take notes as its name suggests.That means that it is not comparable to Word which is really an application designed to build text, even bos, formatted text, long text. It is not the purpose of OneNote. It is very good at taking quick notespretty much as you could do on a piece of paper as I've done a few time ago and I've got one on my  desktop here. So it is comparable to a piece of paper but pretty much more user-friendlybecause you can use it when you work with another application. We could  take notes in a few instant because there would be an icon to switch to OneNote and take a quick note. So at the very startyou connect to Quick Notes. You will find it in English to explain what you can do with that and even at the end there is a small video that you can take. It’s one minute, really short and you can take it and view it to find how it works.Then you can take advantage of this note-taking tool. We are on the interface. It is very easy if you are familiar with Office 365 or Outlo 2016. You may recognize the tabs which gives you access to lots of commands.Depending on the tabs know that the ribbon always changes to provide you with the best commands related to the topic you’re in, for example, you have all the commands to insert itemsin your page, in your notebo. If you want to use the drawing tool of OneNote, the ribbon changes and provides you with all the tools related to drawing, etc.If you are familiar with it, you will probably not be very much estranged by this ribbon. On the left part of the screen is the navigation pane where you will navigate between notebos because you may have different notebos.In the middle, you can access the notebo itselfwith a blank page if you are not in the Quick Notes that were part of the initiating page. At the far right, you find buttons saying “Add Page”, meaning that here you will find all the pages. If we lo at the Quick Notes which is kind of aLet's start from the beginning. The first time you arrive there, once you've discovered Quick Notes explaining how to work with OneNote, you may want to create a notebo. For that, right-click on the navigation pane. There is “New Notebo…” and this is the first possibilityprovided to you by OneNote, which is to create your notebo. You can create it online in the Cloud by using the OneDrive, may it be personal or organizational, professional.This one is professional; this one is my personal. Or in a SharePoint also related to a company in a SharePoint site. You may decide to create this notebo online totake advantage of your online features, that is that you can connect to his notebo from anywhere in the world, with any device, be it a smartphone, a tablet or a PC. There are other web locations which arerelated to Office 365 online but you can  decide to create it on this. You  give a name to the notebo and you click on Create Notebo.Here is your first notebo with the first section. You give a name to the section.Now you are ready to take notes. You can double click to change the name of the section, the first chapter if we compare to a bo for example, which is something more complex than  a piece of paper.Here is my first page. Now, what is very clear and very easy to do is that wherever you click in this pane,the system will instantly take a note.If I click here in the middle, this is another one.So it's very easy to take a note. If you click  in the same place, this will be added to your first note.That's the first possibility, wherever you write, the system understands, and it takes a note. There is no necessity to format or to have anything in mind prepared, you  take a note, that’s exactly the function ofthis application: Taking quick notes wherever you are, during a meeting. This is the first thing. There are formatting possibilities. If you select what you have  written, you can put it in bold, you can increase the font, decide what font, you can change the color of the letters,you can change the background, you can do many things and you can even format painter to apply the same formatting to this other part of the document, to these notes.So when you select something, you can change it. Afterwards, you can can format the notes that you have taken, and you can move things everywhere.You can give a style to this note. First, you can write anything anywhere. Here we have a notebook in the navigation pane.Here we have a section, this is a page. On the far right this is the page and we can add another page. It is untitled but here we can give it a name.So it is very easy and we can switch between pages easily. If we need another, right click in the navigation pane. We can create a new section.We are in Section 2, there is no page so we can give another page another name.each time that you take a note, you can, with a right-click, access to many things. That's usual with Office 365 or the Office suite on your desktop 2016.The right-click is very important, for example, you can change the name and it proposes you something when it does not recognize what's been written down. Here there is something interesting, formatting, but also something called “Tag” and with it you can instantlygive a tag to what you write down and say that is important. You can even highlightand use many other Tags to these Quick Notes that you have taken. If it is critical, you can highlight it different ways, move it, right-click, give a Tag, etc. Discuss with a person, give a namecall back… Anything that you can do with these quick notes that you have taken. If we look at the ribbon, there is a To Do Tag and you can in a quick instant add a To Do Tag so have different tasks.Once it is done, you click to show this has been done. It’s a very easy way to create quick notes but you have much more than only Quick Notes written or somewhere on your monitor, or somewhere on your own physical desktop.So it's between a piece of paper and Word which is something to create nearly books or at least long texts formatted with many other functions. Here it is the same as with the right-click. What is also very interesting is thatin these notes you can insert many things: Tables, and you decide which kind of table it is and you have a table.You just have to fill in. You can insert and once you have created the table,you have the layout you can change.Insert file attachments, attach a file that we open quickly, attach a file, insert a chart or table, insert a spreadsheet.So let's attach a file. If you double click, you open the document, which is here.Sheet 1 and sheet 2. So it’s a very easy way to insert. You can insert pictures.Then you can resize the picture.You can insert online pictures that you may find on the web, using for example Bing, if you want to have some something.You can also insert videos and you can record audio and video; It will be added to this part of the notebook. If you select the Screen Clipping, you can directly copy a screenshot of your screen.With Screen Clipping, you have the name, time and date.You can also insert a Date and Time. It's interesting, you can make many different things with Insert. You can draw with a few objects. For example, you can underline everything, erase with a Small Eraser, Medium Eraser, you can change the color of your highlighter.You can insert objects, shapes and you can insert Page Templates. For example, Formal Meeting Notes. There is a template to take notes, so it means that now instantly you can havea template that you can use for a meeting where you can have an agenda, the attendees, you can insertdate and time, attendees and you can write “Were present”.Instantly you can have these templates.If you select the page template on the far right, you'll get all the page templates. A lot are available because I've used 3 languages. But they are all the same, detailed notes,see the course… There are many templates that you may reuse directly in this OneNote.History: Once you have been creating new notebooks and you start working with it with different days, if you are different authors for this, if you click here on the tab,you see Recent Edits and you can find all the edits today. On the far right, there is a new pane open and that will show me all that has been modified.You can search the notebook, search sections, etc. If you want to find who has been creating something.Quickly take notes between the piece of paper Microsoft Office Word. At the end, once you have finished creating you notebook,  if you go to Filesit's instantly synchronized.If you want to share it, if it has not been synchronized, if it's not on OneDrive, you will select Move Notebook to OneDrive if you have been creating it on your computer.Your notebook is now syncing to the new location, now a new field is opening, and you can share it with someone in your organization or someone else.Even the people with whom you are sharing this document will be able to edit or view the content of the document. I suggest that you require users to sign in before accessing the documentto improve the security of this document in case you have something sensitive, something that you don't want to share with everybody. This document will be shared with people so we can click here.Remove people. It is shared instantly and you can get a sharing link if you don't want to share it with someone inside the organization by getting sharing a link,you can create a view link and an edit link. If you create a link, you will be able to copy it and paste it in a message in Outlook and send it to somebody that will receive this link and by clicking this link, if it's an edit link,they will be able to edit the document. If you select Create a view link, they will only be able to view the link. Anyone with an edit link can edit.If you are in a meeting for example, a Skype for business meeting, which is also included in the Office 365, you can instantly Share with Meeting. You will instantly share this notebook in the meeting with all the audience, all the participants.There are many possibilities to create quick note and to share it afterwards.One thing regarding the online version: OneNote online is part of the Office 365 version, to connect to the Office 365 account online, you need to enter “portal.office.com” on any web browser address bar.Once connected, you will get the list of all your applications online and you will find OneNote and it is the same as the desktop version.You see the list of all your notebooks, wherever you are you can consult your notebooks.OneNote Online has exactly the same tabs:The ribbon and the commands related to the tabs, the notebook, the sections. You can create a new section, can create a new page. You can change, format text, insert but you have less possibilities than on the desktop.But you can insert sections and pictures online, you can change the view, you can show authors, you have a reading view, etc. Once you have created, you can create notebooks online.There is an alert because something coming from the Web is trying toopen the computer. There is a connection between the online notebook and OneNote on your desktop.From the app launcher, you can access directly wherever you are, and you can open a notebook.So here is what we could say about OneNote, on computer and online.Thanks for attending and try to make good use of it.

Skype for business - Advanced users,"Hello and welcome to this short training session on Office MOOC training.2This session is related to “Getting started with Office” and Office 3653and this particular session is entitled “Advanced User: Go further with Skype for Business”.4My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your presenter for this short session.5Just before we get started, I’ll just to ask you not to take any other calls if possible.6If you need to go away from your PC or your desk, please do so and come back as soon as you can.7Keep your phones mute and unmute if you have questions.8You can type questions in the chat box if you prefer.9I advise you to stay so active on your PC, move your mouse or touch the keyboard once in a while. It will possibly go to sleep mode,10so make sure you keep it active, particularly on laptop devices.11Let's have a look at what we're covering.12In this session, we will look at managing your contacts using contact groups in Skype for Business.13Enriching your Skype meetings additional collaborative tools,14additional content.15Configuring your interface and various Skype for business settings in your options.16We’ll look at managing automatic status updates, replies17and configure audio and video equipment to use Skype for Business.18Lastly we’ll have a look at using PBX exchange type desk phone with Skype Business as well.19At this point we're assuming you're generally happy with the basic purpose and use of Skype for Business in terms of its concepts, instant messaging chat and voice/video calls, etc.20and we're concentrating more on configuring our Skype for Business environment and settings and enriching our communication.21So the objective of the session is to discover Skype for Business and be happy, configuring various settings and options in Skype for Business.22It's not really a training session, it's more a presentation about the use and configuration possibilities of Skype for Business.23Let's get started.24If you have added contacts to your Skype contact list, it's easy to manage and organize them.25You can easily find, sort, rename, remove contacts if you need to.26You can organize them by using contact groups.27Groups are essentially collections of contacts.28You can can create and see several contacts displayed in their own sections29and you can communicate with all members at the same time.30For example, you can instant message chat with them,31start a video call,32send email or schedule a meeting with all those people in that group in one click33rather than individually select multiple contacts from the list.34You decide what groups you want and who should belong to each group.35For example, you might create a group for you and  your colleagues working on the same projects,36you might set up a second group for people you're working with on another project,37and maybe a third one containing family and friends and so on.38You can delete groups as easily as you create them.39If you add a contact to your contacts list,40not to group but just to your contacts list,41and decide not to assign them to a group as you add them42Skype automatically adds them to a catchall group called ""other contacts"",43which has got the same access level as a colleague which we will see in a moment.44That's a little look at the environment.45On the screen, you can see how to create a new group.46You can click the icon with 2 people with a plus sign47and choose ""Create a New Group"".48Or you can right-click on existing groups in the groups list49and choose ""Create New Group"".50Let's open Skype for Business.51We can see our groups over here.52There are tabs for groups, status, relationships and new.53Let's have a look at groups.54These are subtabs55and they different ways of viewing your contacts.56This way, you view them by groups,57This way you see your contacts by the status: online, offline, away, etc.58and this one by relationships to you as a contact. We will look at it in a moment.59The New tab shows you if any people have added you as a contact recently.60They'll show up in the list. You can right-click and add them to your contacts list and particular groups if you want to.61We're concentrating on groups.62We've got people in our favorite list63and other contacts.64You can collapse the groups with the little arrows if you want to hide the group65or expand it, you can do that as well.66By clicking on the arrow, you can collapse and expand the group.67You can click this group and see that members of that group called Team will appear.68I can move people from group to group.69I can add contacts to a group and so on.70If I right-click Fabrice, I get options to copy the contact.71I can copy it to another group72called web contacts,73or I can choose to move him to web contacts.74It means that when I choose ""Move"" they're going to be moved from the team to web contacts75and if I choose ""Copy"" they're going to be in both groups.76They are management groups and it makes it easier to communicate with them on mass.77If I choose ""Copy To"" web contacts for example,78and we expand, we see that Fabrice is now in there. Let's do that with another one, like Guillaume.79Right-click on Guillaume and choose “Copy to”80web contacts and he is also in there.81These people are in multiple groups.82If I choose to remove them from the group,83right-click and choose ""Remove from Group"".84They still exist in the other group,85it's not a security membership group but a grouping in Skype for Business for communication purposes.86You can also drag and drop people from group to group.87Drag someone and release them.88I can move Guillaume from that group to the other group or right-click or drag and drop.89Contacts come along to multiple groups.90To communicate with a group91right-click on a name.92Rather than having to individually select each of these 3 people in this list of contacts or in the team93I can right-click and choose things like “send an IM”94to start a chat with those people, a conference/Skype call,95video call, send an email message or schedule a meeting.96If I choose “Send an IM” for example,97(I will bring that window from my other screen)98all the participants are in: myself and those 3 people in web contacts group are in this list.99If I click on the participants pane it will open the full pane to show the users.100It's a very quick way of having an IM chat with 3 other people at the same time, rather than having to individually select them and add them to the conversation.101We can do that.102We can also do things like start a call,103send an email, schedule a meeting with these groups on mass that way.104It's very easy to create a new group.105We saw before that you have this little button.106It says ""Add a contact"", ""Create a group"", customized list.107Choose “Create a New Group”108and we have a new group.109highlighted at the bottom of the screen and I will call it ""Marketing"".110You see the group ""Marketing"" down here and you will see its members in a moment.111You can112move someone to that group.113I will move around Fabrice as well.114Now I got 2 people in the new Marketing group.115Again, I can right-click and start a call, meeting, instant message chat with them ans so on.116I can add participants to that particular communication call or chat or whatever.117It's an easy way of adding multiple people to a group for organization and communication purposes.118You can communicate with them on mass in various ways by right-clicking on the name of the group119and then choosing the appropriate option.120That is different obviously from selecting an individual user121and choosing to send an IM that's going to start instant message with that one participant (myself and Fabrice in this case).122You could add more people to the call,123but it's obviously much quicker to select,124especially if these are small groups of people. If you have groups of 20 or 30 people125it's much easier to select the group and work with it that way.126Head back to the slides, contact groups.127Privacy relationships:128they control how much of your online presence information other people can see.129Each of your contacts has 1/5 privacy relationships with you.130Each relationship gives access to different amounts of information.131For example, the colleagues is the relationship new contacts are given by default when you add them.132They can learn more about where you are, when you'll be available and how to reach you for example,133than external contacts might.134But equally they can get less information than someone who's in the workgroup relationship.135There's another one called ""Friends and Family"" which gives more information than all the others together.136There's one exception to that in the contacts: workgroup.137That's one of those you can see on the slide called ""Workgroup"".138Let's maximize that slide and this workgroup.139They may need to find your work site.140For these contacts only, they can see your meeting location information141and get your attention via Skype for Business even if you set yourself to ""Do not disturb"".142We will talk about that in a moment.143These are the types of relationships.144Right-click a contact to change privacy relationship.145You can see on the slide the different levels of privacy you get.146Friends and Family: share your notes, location, contact information except meeting details.147Workgroup: share your notes, location, contact information except Home and Other phone but they can interrupt your Do Not Disturb status.148Colleagues: share notes, location, contact information except Home, Other and Mobile and meeting details but they can't interrupt your Do Not Disturb status.149External contacts: name, title, email, company and picture. No information on your notes or location or contact information.150Blocked contacts: name and email address and they can't reach you via Skype for Business.151Let's see that in the application itself.152Here are the relationships.153We can see our relationships and who's in those relationships: friends and family, workgroup, colleagues,154and then scroll down, we can see external contacts and blocked contacts.155There's no one in blocked contacts, but you can collapse and expand these156by clicking on this arrow to expand and collapse those relationships.157In terms of how people get added to them,158I will show you how to add a contact: I'm choosing a contact within my organization.159I could try and find a particular user.160Let's try in this case Fabien.161I can right-click Fabien and say ""Add to Contact List""162and ""Change Privacy Relationship"".163I can then select which relationship they should be in.164I'm saying that they're going to be in workgroup for example.165Then I can say in which which group: marketing.166He is copied in marketing.167In the relationships, he appears in workgroup.168When you add a new contact you select their privacy relationship as you add them.169Right-click on the person, change relationship to make him a colleague instead, I could do that.170Then that user will change to colleagues if we refresh that in a moment.171Now in terms of enriching our meetings.172Skype for Business enables you to enrich your communications in Skype173by doing things like transferring files,174sharing selected programs or your entire desktop.175You can display PowerPoint presentations176and you can use collaboration, co-authoring on documents in real time as well.177Within a chat or a meeting, you can click on the share content button.178That's this icon you can see in the center left,179that sort of arrow going up to the right top right of it.180Click on that button and choose the extra content you want to add.181If you already added it to share it182then choose the Manage Content option.183to actually manage the existing shared content you shared with other people.184At the top, you have ""Share your Desktop"" to share an entire desktop.185This might be quite useful for training purposes or help desk or showing someone what you're working on186rather than having to send them the document, file or whatever it is.187You can also share a window or share programs.188When you choose “Share a Window”, it asks you which of your currently opened applications you'd like to share with the user.189You can share PowerPoint files.190That's not exactly sharing the file, you're actually sharing sort of a presentation remotely191and you can then use annotation tools to work on those slides together and annotate them.192You can also Co-Author Office documents.193When you choose Co-Author Office doc. you can select meeting from OneDrive or somewhere194to then work collaboratively in real time with those other users in the call.195You might open a Word document and work at 3 or 4 on the same document at the same time,196working on different paragraphs, editing it and using online document with an online tool to access the document and work with it collaboratively.197You can also do things like add attachments, share notes.198When you click on the More button above Manage Content199you can also see extra tools like a white board for drawing200drawing, mapping out ideas, diagrams and so on.201There's also a polling tool: if you want to get feedback from people on particular questions, create a poll and ask people to respond. There's also a Q&A tool.202These are ways of adding extra enrichment to your meeting or call.203Let's go back and look at that in Skype.204I will change myself to available for a moment.205I will right-click on Guillaume and start instant message chat with that user.206Here's the share content button.207I can click on that and I got the menu we saw on the slide: share your desktop, share program,208share PowerPoint files and so on,209Co-Author Office documents, add attachments.210And this is more button to access the whiteboard or poll to get feedback and also Q&A session for presenters to answer.211Once you've actually got content shared, you can click on manage content,212which will then say that this is the content you're currently sharing in your meeting, your call, your IM,213what you want to do with it: stop sharing it and share with someone else or add something to it for example.214Let's choose an option.215If you share a window, it will ask you which one of your open applications you want to share,216it will show a list of all your currently open apps.217You can select which one you want to share.218If you choose to share desktop,219you can choose which desktop you're sharing220if you got multiple screens and you can select which screen you want to share.221If you share PowerPoint files, browse to find a file.222Let's do that one for example.223You can select the file and choose Open but we won't do it for now, it will take too long to load,224but you can then share that presentation.225You'll see a staging window where you can go through the slides and annotate together with the people in the call with you.226It is slightly different if you're working with someone using the public version of Skype.227Let's find someone.228This person here.229Right-click.230Click on the IM. This person is using the public version of Skype, not Skype for Business. I click on the content button.231It's much more restrictive in terms of what things they can share.232The options aren't sharing my programs or desktop, PowerPoint files.233I can still add attachments and co-author Office documents by sending links to documents, that kind of thing,234but none of the other possibilities for collaborating or interacting with someone using Skype for Business.235That's enriching our meetings.236In terms of customizing the interface of Skype237we got quite a few options.238We can use the alert section in the options239to configure interface settings for displaying alerts,240displaying how contacts are displayed if they are using public Skype for example.241Click on the cog icon so it opens up the options and then in the alert section that we can see on the page here.242We can see those options:243some general alerts, enabled taskbar notifications for offline and missed IMs.244Where should they appear: you can where those alerts should appear.245For example, if you tag someone when they come online, it wants to notify you and246you'll see those pop-up and it'll say when someone is Online again.247Or if someone's trying to send you something or a message chat,248you'll see that pop up in the corner249and you can choose top, left, right, bottom, etc.250If you have several monitors you can select which monitor it's on.251You can also choose things for Do Not Disturb:252don't show alerts,253show only alerts for people in your workgroup relationship254or show all alerts so it is slightly less restricted and they can break open the Do Not Disturb status to contact you should they need to.255Lastly, contacts that aren't using Skype for Business (public Skype, for example):256should they be able to contact you or do you block them.257It's on their settings down there on the alerts tab.258Then we got our status update.259You can use this section in options to specify how and to whom your status is displayed in Skype for Business.260If you've been inactive on your computer, Skype for Business automatically changes your status261and if you haven't moved your mouse or taken the keyboard action or something for a specified period of time262then Skype for Business changes status indication and chooses ""Inactive"".263After you've been inactive for a specified period of time, Skype for Business changes from Inactive to Away.2645 minutes is the default period for Inactive and then for Away265but you can specify a longer time for either or both of them.266The minimum you can specify is 5 minutes and the maximum is 360 minutes.267The privacy mode is the 2 buttons below that those status pin boxes.268Everyone except blocked contacts can see your present status.269To modify that setting, click on the options button, go to the status section in the options270and then choose one of the following options.271I want everyone to be able to see my presence.272We have the assistance settings, the default,273or you can choose the system administrator should decide.274Currently everyone can see your presence, but this could change if the system administrator changes that default setting to block other people from seeing you275depending on your organizations settings.276If they've already enabled privacy mode in Skype for Business,277you're going to see slightly different options than these previous ones.278You can use these options to limit visibility of your presence information279if your organization already enabled that privacy mode.280Then you're going to see an option that says ""I want everyone to be able to see my presence""281or ""I only want people in my contacts list to see my presence"".282It will change slightly what this status box looks like in your settings283if they've got the option on.284The Do Not Disturb part of your status:285you can set up to automatically block distracting communications if you are sharing content or giving a presentation286with your Skype for Business enabled computer.287If you enable that, it will change your status to ""Presenting""288whenever you share your screen or duplicate your display in projection mode for example.289Instant message chat with your coworkers will be blocked290and anyone who reads your status will know that you're currently presenting and not to be disturbed.291I will click back to my Skype to see that.292Remember I overrode this to say to make it choose available.293If I go back to reset status it says ""In a meeting"".294If I was showing my desktop through this Skype for Business, or sharing a PowerPoint file or something,295that would be saying ""Presenting"" so it's kind of a system-generated status up here.296Click on the cog icon, go to options,297for alerts this is where you come to choose on which display you should be showing those alerts,298the position on the monitor: top left, top right, bottom left, right, etc.299There's the options for your status when it's on Do Not Disturb,300whether you should see alerts or not.301Then under status where you can modify your settings,302let's say you make it 10 minutes and 20 minutes or something.303The minimum you can go to is 5, it doesn't go any lower than that.304These are the settings: you can choose to override the default configured by the administrator305and there's your options for Do Not Disturb.306Show me as Do Not Disturb when I'm showing my desktop or if it's being duplicated in sort of presentation mode.307It's very easy to get to that either from tools and options308or click on the arrow and choose tools, options,309but the quickest way is to click on the cog icon itself and it opens up the options dialog box.310Now in terms of equipment.311We can set up different bits of equipment to work with Skype for Business.312We'll see audio and video.313There's a couple options settings for things like ringtones and sounds and then audio and video devices.314You can set up to use your computer's built-in mic and speakers or headset315or another device for Skype for Business audio.316For the best audio quality during calls, there is a list if you search for optimized for Skype for Business online,317you'll see this list of optimized devices that work best with Skype for Business.318But on the whole most devices seem to work quite well with it.319You can also set up your video device320for having video calls. For best results, you can call set up and test your camera before you use it.321You need to have a camera to make video calls or if you want to share your video in a meeting322but you don't need one to receive a video call or see other peoples videos since you don't need to display and broadcast your own image.323When you make a video call, Skype automatically displays the video in a window,324but if you're in a Skype for Business meeting325it won't automatically share your video. You need to select it and say ""I would like to share my video by starting my video"".326Let's get back to the options.327You can see some of the options on the screen.328Let's switch out and put it in the live environment.329Ringtones and sounds you can see on the side:330choose ringtones, see a number, do you want to play sounds,331muting incoming alerts if you're in middle of an IM conversation,332play a sound when viewing an IM conversation and someone's typing...333You can choose to modify tones and so on.334Audio device: you can select your headset if you have multiple devices,335you can select one from that drop-down list.336You can test your speaker and ring to make sure it's working: you can see my microphone moving as I speak.337That's proving that the microphone is working and you can adjust those levels if you need to338for audio in and out.339Under video device settings,340I've got a camera plugged in here, you can see your camera and if you have multiple one, you can select in the list.341You can then choose your camera settings342that drags across.343You can use things like flipping the image344and mirroring it and all those kind of things,345black-and-white mode...346You can change things like the brightness in the color, the gamma correction and all that sort of stuff347to play around with until you get something that suits the lighting in your room, the outside, a dark or light room...348I will restore these options back to default settings.349Click OK to get back.350We can see a couple of other things here.351You've got the file saving options, if you're transferring files in calls352you can choose where they get transferred to.353If you're recording sessions, you can choose the location to save those recordings,354and the resolution of those recordings as well.355There's one on Skype meetings:356a couple options: what version of Skype for Business you're going to use,357whether to join audio using Skype for Business, or a phone device.358Whether to show IMs and participants and so on.359That's on your Skype meetings options.360The last thing I'll show you is the PBX options.361I will scroll down to that slide.362If you've got a PBX, a private exchange type desk phone363and it's configured to work with Skype for Business,364you can call people in your organization through Skype for Business365and the audio for the call will go through the phone rather than the headset or Skype itself.366It is a feature the admin has to configure if you're a company.367To tell if your company has enabled that functionality, you go to the options368and when you click on the gear icon to open up the options369you'll get options. If you see Call Handling as you can see on this slide,370then your desktop phone is configured to be integrated with Skype for Business.371All you have to do is set the outgoing calls option to use that number.372You can see that on the slide. Outgoing calls, use this number to make calls and you have a number to use for the outgoing calls.373To make a call you only have to start a Skype for Business call from your client machine.374Your desktop phone will ring, you pick up the desktop phone375then you will hear the other person's phone ringing and once they answer and connect376you can use the audio through your phones to conduct your call.377But even though you're using the audio over the phone378you can still use the collaborative tools in Skype for Business like instant messages, chats and sharing and so on379through the manage content and share content buttons.380That's the way of using a desktop phone for the audio portion381rather than using the Skype for Business PC audio headset type options.382You'll see that for example,383but it is not configured to do so: there's no Call handling and forwarding options since it is not configured to be set up with it.384A couple of things to summarize:385you can use the share content button to enrich your Skype for Business communications,386collaborating with people...387That includes things like showing desktop, windows, PowerPoint files, collaborating on documents in real time.388You can use the options button to customize the interface389and that's a general behavior for Skype for Business390like your status, where alerts appear, that kind of thing.391You can set up your audio and video equipment to work with Skype for Business,392for your calls and meetings.393You can also configure your desktop phone for audio if configured and if desired.394If you have questions, ask them in the chat and we will answer offline.395if there's no other questions at this point, then we can end the session.396Thank you for your time today.397Thank you for attending.398I hope you will make the best use of this resource going forward.399Thank you.",hello welcom short train session offic mooc training2thi session relat get start offic offic 3653and particular session

Organizing a team’s tasks,"You take control of ateam for an internal project.This project will be implemented over several months and requires many tasks. Some of your colleagues are alreadymaking use of tasks inOutlook to get organized.Others simply takeThis does not suit.You want everyone to have aglobal view of the progress.How to simply organize yourself and distribute the tasks to the team members? How to monitor progress and have a global view?Will you have to takestock with each collaborator?If you're in search of asimple way to organize this teamwork, Planner is a great choice.In my case, I need asimple but effective tool.I'm not an expert in planning andI don't need a very advanced tool.You'll find Planner inthe Office 365 application launcher or on the homepage.If you're a part of Office 365 Groups, you'll find them in the panel to the left of the Planner and in the main screen of the Schedule Center.Indeed Planner integratesGroups for more flexibility.When you create a group inOutlook, you can find them in Planner and when you create a new project or plan in Planner, you're actuallycreating a new work group.From Planner, I will thencreate a new plan for my project.That's it. It's very fastand I can very quickly enterinto the thick of things bycreating different buckets.Actually, there areseveral phases in my project.I will use buckets toorganize myself and have an overview of the different phases. For instance, there will be a preparatory phase which I'll call Conception.Then the Realizationand finally Deployment.I will now establish myTo Do list in each bucket.Beginning with theconception phase, you can prepare your To Do lists withoutnecessarily assigning them right awaynor indicating deadlines and details.I save it for later.That's it, my To Do list is ready.Nobody is present in thiswork group for the moment.Remember, while creatingmy plan, I also created an Office 365 group. So now, I'll be able to add members to this project and select collaborators who will have access to this plan either fromOutlook or directly in Planner.By simply typing the names orsurnames, the application offers me results.So I have my tasks on one side, theproject team members on the other.I will be able to assigntasks to each and add deadlines.To do this, I simply click on atask to open the detail window.I can assign it to ateam member who will then be notified of this new task by mail.Give it a start and end date.If necessary, create a checklist or alist of subtasks which can be checked.Add a description,attach files or links.I can now leave the screen.The task is saved. Of course, all those whom I appointed as members of this planwill be able to view this To Dolist and most especially keep it viable.After a few days or weeks ofuse, we will be able to seethe progress, viewentries from collaborators, etc.Taking stock hasnever been this easy.I use group reviews.Here I am grouping by buckets.I can use byassignments or by progress.Or better still, I canswitch to the charts view thatgives me a syntheticoverview of the progress, the number of tasks per person, taskswith exceeded deadlines and ongoing tasks. It is possible to have details of the tasks concerned bydirectly clicking on the graphs.Thanks to this analysis,it is possible to adjust my management by unloadingthe busiest people andreassigning certain tasks tothose who don't have any more.Finally, how Planner ispositioned in the Office suite?Outlook tasks are convenient, butare still for individual organizations.Projects are a very powerfultool, but not easy to handle.Planner is an excellentcompromise and offers simpleorganization possibilitiesat the level of a team withall collaborative toolsand a great ease of use.In addition, Planner iscompletely integrated and nestedto other Office 365 software.Thank you for your attention.",take control ateam intern projectthi project implement sever month requir mani task colleagu alreadymak use task inoutlook get organizedoth simpli takethi suityou want everyon aglob view progresshow simpli organ distribut task team member monitor progress global viewwil takestock collaboratorif your search asimpl way organ teamwork planner great choicein case need asimpl effect toolim expert plan andi dont need advanc toolyoul find planner inth offic 365 applic launcher homepageif your part offic 365 group youll find panel left planner main screen schedul centerinde planner integratesgroup flexibilitywhen creat group inoutlook find planner creat new project plan planner your actuallycr new work groupfrom planner thencreat new plan projectthat fastand quickli enterinto thick thing bycreat differ bucketsactu aresever phase projecti use bucket toorgan overview differ phase instanc preparatori phase ill call conceptionthen realizationand final deploymenti establish myto list bucketbegin theconcept phase prepar list withoutnecessarili assign right awaynor indic deadlin detailsi save laterthat list readynobodi present thiswork group momentrememb creatingmi plan also creat offic 365 group ill abl add member project select collabor access plan either fromoutlook directli plannerbi simpli type name orsurnam applic offer resultsso task one side theproject team member otheri abl assigntask add deadlinesto simpli click atask open detail windowi assign ateam member notifi new task mailgiv start end dateif necessari creat checklist alist subtask checkedadd descriptionattach file linksi leav screenth task save cours appoint member planwil abl view dolist especi keep viableaft day week ofus abl seeth progress viewentri collabor etctak stock hasnev easyi use group reviewsher group bucketsi use byassign progressor better still canswitch chart view thatgiv syntheticoverview progress number task per person taskswith exceed deadlin ongo task possibl detail task concern bydirectli click graphsthank analysisit possibl adjust manag unloadingth busiest peopl andreassign certain task tothos dont morefin planner isposit offic suiteoutlook task conveni butar still individu organizationsproject powerfultool easi handleplann excellentcompromis offer simpleorgan possibilitiesat level team withal collabor toolsand great eas usein addit planner iscomplet integr nestedto offic 365 softwarethank attent

Enrich tasks content,"Here are a few tips on how to makeour plan in Planner more attractive.Starting from your Planner hub...On your right, you can find your favorites.And underneath, the plans you recentlyconsulted or modified... And over here,the ones you've created or joined.I will use a model: ""Translation"".I'll click on this plan.As you notice on the board,there is a background image.And then... This board is made out of a few""Buckets"", underneath... which there area list of tasks ... Like these...I can even see the completedones at the bottom.Each task is representedby a card based interface.When I click on them,I can see the details of that card,so I can see the title.The people that were assigned to this task,as well as colored labelscustomized; And I can see the listof ""Buckets"" for the plan...The ""Progress""...The level of ""Priority""... the ""Start date""...""End date""... As well as the personal ""Note""...the ""Checklist"" that was created...So, we can uncheck these itemsor check them as we go along.We also have the option tochange the order of this list.And you can add more.We have the possibility to add imagesto cards as well as audio video...Any type of files integratedwith Microsoft Office.You just have to click on ""Add attachment"".You can either locate a file from yourPC, from a website, or from the library...In the SharePoint site...which is the team's SharePoint site.And then you will see that we havethe possibility of selecting tosee either the note, the checklist,or one of these attachments...On the face of the card.And this one is the imagethat represents the card.So now let's use a modelthat we just started off...in an earlier session...and let's personalize it.I click on the card,I changed the title first to ""Idea 3""...Then I assigned this cardto a colleague of mine... outside the company...To myself... And underneath, I can see thelist of all the members of the team.I'll pick Stephen Watson andthere... I've selected three people.I can see the colored labels andthose are already customized cards.If I click here, I can add another one,maybe for ""Power Apps""... I'll pickthe ""Lavender"" one and I'll go aheadand change the name to Power Apps.There! Now, I have personalized mycategories of labels... And under ""Progress""...I can change this to ""In progress"" and maybechange the ""Priority"" level to ""Medium""this time. I can also adda ""Start date"" from here...End date... There we go! And I couldpersonalize this ""Note"" even further...I'll leave it as is. And whenit comes to the ""Checklist""...I can see I already started some...But I could change the order of thischecklist like so... And I can add a new one...Let's say... ""Step 4""...To be realized by ""Dina Gmail"".And Steven...And now,  I'm going to go ahead...""Add attachments""... I can add them from my PC...It could be audio, video, images.I'll start with a picture.Let's see over here. There we go... AndI'll add another file from my PC.An Excel file... this time.So I have... ""Show on card""...Either I want my notes to be displayed,it will appear this way: ""to bevalidated by project Manager""...Or I can go back to thecard and switch category,which would be my checklist.You can only pick one of thosecategories at a time... And this way I cancheck these as I go...I'll go back to the card.Uncheck these items and probablyselect instead the image which Iprefer so I can locate faster my task.It's personalized... And I can go aheadnow and personalize the board.I'll go to the three littledots... ""Plan settings""....And pick, for instance, this background.And just like that,I've made my plan a littlemore attractive and I alsohave personalized my tasks.Now you know how to enrich your own tasks.",tip makeour plan planner attractivestart planner hubon right find favoritesand underneath plan recentlyconsult modifi hereth one youv creat joinedi use model translationil click plana notic boardther background imageand board made fewbucket underneath area list task like thesei even see completedon bottomeach task representedbi card base interfacewhen click themi see detail cardso see titleth peopl assign taska well color labelscustom see listof bucket planth progressth level prioriti start dateend date well person noteth checklist createdso uncheck itemsor check go alongw also option tochang order listand add morew possibl add imagesto card well audio videoani type file integratedwith microsoft officey click add attachmenty either locat file yourpc websit libraryin sharepoint sitewhich team sharepoint siteand see haveth possibl select tose either note checklistor one attachmentson face cardand one imagethat repres cardso let use modelthat start offin earlier sessionand let person iti click cardi chang titl first idea 3then assign cardto colleagu mine outsid companyto underneath see thelist member teamil pick stephen watson andther ive select three peoplei see color label andthos alreadi custom cardsif click add anoth onemayb power app ill pickth lavend one ill go aheadand chang name power appsther person mycategori label progressi chang progress maybechang prioriti level mediumthi time also adda start date hereend date go couldperson note even furtheril leav whenit come checklisti see alreadi start somebut could chang order thischecklist like add new onelet say step 4to realiz dina gmailand stevenand im go go aheadadd attach add pcit could audio video imagesil start picturelet see go andil add anoth file pcan excel file timeso show cardeith want note displayedit appear way bevalid project manageror go back thecard switch categorywhich would checklisty pick one thosecategori time way cancheck goill go back carduncheck item probablyselect instead imag ipref locat faster taskit person go aheadnow person boardil go three littledot plan settingsand pick instanc backgroundand like thativ made plan littlemor attract alsohav person tasksnow know enrich task

Introduction,"Skype for business allows you to use a landline, telephone number to make and receive calls.As you would with the traditional telephone.Using just your PC.There are 2 possible ways to set it up.Either you only use your PC in Skype for business for making calls or you can link your Skype to a fixed IP phone.In which case you can use it both to make and manage your calls.The following steps in this video can be applied to ether setup.Please note that if you have an account that allows you to use the audio in Skype for business. You can use it on a tablet or on a smart phone by downloading the necessary applications, which will thereby allow you to make and receive calls with your mobile phone using for example, a Wi-Fi connection.If you already have Skype for business software. It is not necessary to update the software.Simply launch it, and your login and password would do with the rest.This is how the software identifies that your account is associated with a landline, telephone number and that you were able to process calls via Skype for business.Once connected to your Skype for business account. You will see this tab called phone appear which you will primarily use for handling calls.Of course, you must be connected to the service in order to receive calls. Otherwise, the calls will be forwarded directly to your voicemail.This phone tab looks like this here, you have a dial pad using which you can directly enter telephone numbers and make calls and below there is the voicemail.Where you will be able to retrieve any voice messages that show contacts have left for you?One of the first things to do when you begin to use this service is perhaps to check the quality of the call by making a test call.In other words, simply click check and Skype will launch a call to a service that let's you record a short voice message, which you can then hear back and thereby test the quality of the audio in terms of listening and receiving.Once that's done you're ready to use Skype to make and receive calls.If you have problems with the audio quality or if you have multiple microphones. Sources connected to your PC. You'll be able to choose to use the microphone or speakers using this little icon.Here for example, I have 2 sources, so I can choose either source.If that is not enough, you can also open the audio device settings, which allow you to open a small window from which you can adjust a few settings such as the microphone volume ringtone speaker, etc and also select different sources.Now you are ready to use the service.

Making a call,"Making a call. In this video we will see the differentways of making a call using Skype.Before making a call, as wehave seen in the introductionvideo, first check theconfiguration of your audiodevices to avoid anyunwanted surprises.We will discuss thethree ways of making a call.The first way is thesimplest and most obvious.In the phone tab,you have a dial pad.This means you can eitheruse the dial pad directly orthe keyboard on yourPC to enter numbers.Or you can paste a numberthat you have copied from a webpage, for example,into the number field.Once a number has beenentered, you can use either theEnter key on thekeyboard or the Call button.This action will thendial and make the call.The second way is to makecalls using the lists fromeither the voicemail or call history.In the overview youwill find the Call iconwhich you can use to callsomeone back who has left a message.To find this, go to the call list. In the overview, the Call icon allows youto make a call to this contact.The third way is to startfrom your contact list eitherby just searching for theperson you want to contact orby looking directly inyour list of favourites.I'm going to browse over theimage of a person and in theCall Options I'm going toexpand the shortlist so that Ican choose the number thatI want to call for a contactwho has several phone numbers.A communication windowopens in which I find a buttonthat allows me toview the call controls.What are these call controls?Simply said, these consist of thedial pad which you can use during a call.The dial pad is particularlyuseful if, for example, youare using a voice server thatrequires you to key in choices.You will be able to do soby simply using the keyboardand the listeningvolume which can be adjusted.Going back to the main window thereis, of course, the option to hang up.There are two ways to enda call, either I can pressHang-up with this buttonhere, or I can close this windowdirectly which willallow me to hang up.In this case, a warning will pop upas closing the window mayhave been done instinctivelywithout realising thatthis will end the call.For this reason, Skypealerts you to let you know that ifyou close this window itwill end the call in progress.If this is intentional, simply clickOK and the call will be terminated.",make call video see differentway make call use skypebefor make call wehav seen introductionvideo first check theconfigur audiodevic avoid anyunw surprisesw discuss thethre way make callth first way thesimplest obviousin phone tabyou dial padthi mean eitherus dial pad directli orth keyboard yourpc enter numbersor past numberthat copi webpag exampleinto number fieldonc number beenent use either theenter key thekeyboard call buttonthi action thendial make callth second way makecal use list fromeith voicemail call historyin overview youwil find call iconwhich use callsomeon back left messageto find go call list overview call icon allow youto make call contactth third way startfrom contact list eitherbi search theperson want contact orbi look directli inyour list favouritesim go brows theimag person thecal option im go toexpand shortlist ican choos number thati want call contactwho sever phone numbersa commun windowopen find buttonthat allow toview call controlswhat call controlssimpli said consist thedial pad use callth dial pad particularlyus exampl youar use voic server thatrequir key choicesy abl sobi simpli use keyboardand listeningvolum adjustedgo back main window therei cours option hang upther two way enda call either presshangup buttonher close windowdirectli willallow hang upin case warn pop upa close window mayhav done instinctivelywithout realis thatthi end callfor reason skypealert let know ifyou close window itwil end call progressif intent simpli clickok call termin
Receiving and managing a call,"Receiving and managing a call.When you receive a phonecall in Skype for business youwill receive notifications that lookvery much like a chat notification.It's a small window thatwill be displayed at the bottomright of your screenindicating the name of the person,if listed your contacts ofcourse, or the phone number.You have several options whenit comes to receiving the call.First, there is the Ignoreoption that willallow you to ignore it.This action willsimply reject the call.In the options list,you can either re-directthe call to voicemail ifyou do not wish to answer thecall but want the person tobe able to leave a voicemail.Or you can set it to Do not disturb.Should you select this option, youwill no longer receive notifications.Then the last option, ofcourse, is to accept the call bysimply clicking inthe notification window.In doing so, you will instantly startthe conversation with your correspondent.When you receive a phone callthe window is a littledifferent from the conversationwindow instantly showing youcall control functions, thealphanumeric keypad andcall options as well as the volume.In the call options,there is the option to put someone on hold.By pressing this the personwill hear the hold music set up on your system.They will not be able to hearyou and, similarly, youwill not be able to hear them.To open the call oncemore, simply use theResume button and continue withthe call, it's the same thing.A second way to put someoneon hold is also to disablethe microphone simply by muting it.In this case you will stillbe able to hear the persontalk but they will not be able tohear you which can sometimes be useful.You can thenreactivate the microphone.We'll go over the Calltransfer button in another video.Controlling audio devicescan be useful if you useseveral devices duringcommunications. You can switch device completely,for example fromspeaker mode to headset mode, etc.Finally, the last thing youmay have noticed is that onceyou accept a call thestatus automatically changes andyou switch to In call whichtells other members of yourteam, most importantly ororganisation, that you are on acall and that they shouldperhaps avoid interrupting you then.From the moment you hang-upthe status will revert to Available.",receiv manag callwhen receiv phonecal skype busi youwil receiv notif lookveri much like chat notificationit small window thatwil display bottomright screenind name personif list contact ofcours phone numbery sever option whenit come receiv callfirst ignoreopt willallow ignor itthi action willsimpli reject callin option listyou either redirectth call voicemail ifyou wish answer thecal want person tobe abl leav voicemailor set disturbshould select option youwil longer receiv notificationsthen last option ofcours accept call bysimpli click inth notif windowin instantli startth convers correspondentwhen receiv phone callth window littlediffer conversationwindow instantli show youcal control function thealphanumer keypad andcal option well volumein call optionsther option put someon holdbi press personwil hear hold music set systemthey abl hearyou similarli youwil abl hear themto open call oncemor simpli use theresum button continu withth call thinga second way put someoneon hold also disableth microphon simpli mute itin case stillb abl hear persontalk abl tohear sometim usefuly thenreactiv microphonewel go calltransf button anoth videocontrol audio devicescan use usesever devic duringcommun switch devic completelyfor exampl fromspeak mode headset mode etcfin last thing youmay notic oncey accept call thestatu automat chang andyou switch call whichtel member yourteam importantli ororganis acal shouldperhap avoid interrupt thenfrom moment hangupth statu revert avail
Managing two calls,"Managing two calls.In this video we shall seehow to handle multiple calls.This involves receivinganother call or switching toanother call yourself while you arealready on the line to someone else.If you are already talkingto someone on the phone, youcan still receive another call.It's the sameprocedure as receiving a call.You have exactly the sameoptions, you can accept the call,you can ignore it, oryou can divert it to voicemail.In this case, I willsimply accept the call.You might want to let theperson you are already on thephone with know that youwill be accepting another callbecause Skype willautomatically put that person on hold.So, as I said, theinitial call automatically goeson hold and you will beconnected to the second caller.To then be able to swap fromone to the other and go backto the first call is simple becausethese two windows are completely independent.You can resume the first callwhich will automaticallyput the second call on hold.And this then allows you to go backand forth between different callers.Once again, as thewindows are independent, I canhang up and easilyreturn to the first call.On the other hand, ifI wish to make a secondcall to someone else duringa call myself, the procedureis the same as if Iwere making a first call.I will either go into thePhone tab and dial the numberor go to the Contact windowand select a number to call.It's the same principle. I can resume the other call and put it on holdin order to potentially take a third call as I please.In doing so, the two other calls willautomatically be puton hold independently.",manag two callsin video shall seehow handl multipl callsthi involv receivinganoth call switch toanoth call arealreadi line someon elseif alreadi talkingto someon phone youcan still receiv anoth callit sameprocedur receiv callyou exactli sameopt accept callyou ignor oryou divert voicemailin case willsimpli accept callyou might want let theperson alreadi thephon know youwil accept anoth callbecaus skype willautomat put person holdso said theiniti call automat goeson hold beconnect second callerto abl swap fromon go backto first call simpl becausethes two window complet independenty resum first callwhich automaticallyput second call holdand allow go backand forth differ callersonc thewindow independ canhang easilyreturn first callon hand ifi wish make secondcal someon els duringa call procedurei iwer make first calli either go thephon tab dial numberor go contact windowand select number callit principl resum call put holdin order potenti take third call pleasein two call willautomat puton hold independ
Transferring a call,"Transferring a call.In this video, we will see thedifferent ways of transferring a call.There are three waysto transfer a call.One way is to transfer a call blind.In other words, a call canbe transferred to a contactwithout consulting them first.Another option is to makea conference call transferleaving the two callerson the line to each other.A final way is totransfer a call having previouslyagreed to do sowith the other contact.In this case, you, firstof all, consult the personbefore transferring the call to them.Let's start with the firstexample: transferring a call blind.When you are already on a call, youwill have the option to transfer it.This could be foundbehind this button.When you use this feature,Skype will ask you to select acontact or search for one bytyping the name of a person.If that person has severalphone numbers, you will beable to select the number youwish to call from the overview.Another option is to typethe number directly into thisinput box and press Transfer. In this case, the person receivingthe call will, of course, be invited.Then, once he or sheanswers the call, I can exit thecall and leave the twoparties on the call together.So that's the first type oftransfer: transferring a call blind.That is to say, I havenot consulted the personbefore transferring the call.So it is a direct transfer.The second option when youare already on a call, is thatyou can also call or addsomeone to the call and thenhang up yourself, in order toleave the two parties on the call.In this case, what I'll dois use the Invite More Peoplebutton to add a person tothe call that's in progress.There's a small windowwhich will ask you to select theperson you want to add,or I'll number directly.The third person is invited.And when he or she accepts thecall, it will appear as you see it here.Now all three of us areparticipating in the same call.Meaning that we can havea three-way discussion.Now, in order to leavethese two people together, youjust need to hang upand leave the call.This will not terminate thecall completely because thetwo people will stay together and willbe able to continue the conversation.Finally, the third option:transferring a call with prior consultation.When I am on a call with afirst party, I will simplyinitiate a second call via theSkype window, like this, for example.This will enable me toput the first call on hold.When a second personanswers, I can then introduce theperson to them or explain thereason for the call being transferred.This method allows me toswitch from one to another if,for example, this persondoes not have much time andwants to know if thecall is urgent or not.I can always return to the firstcall and put the second call on hold.To clarify the request a little,discuss the reason for the call, etc.I can resume this calluntil this person accepts thetransfer, and in that case,I will then use the Transferbutton that can be found here.The window that lets youselect a contact opens.I will be able to choose thecurrent call as the transfer destination.It is this person I amcurrently talking to.I then select thisperson and transfer the call.Once I hang up, the two partieswill remain together on the call.We have looked at three ways totransfer a call on Skype for Business.",transfer callin video see thediffer way transfer callther three waysto transfer callon way transfer call blindin word call canb transfer contactwithout consult firstanoth option makea confer call transferleav two callerson line othera final way totransf call previouslyagre sowith contactin case firstof consult personbefor transfer call themlet start firstexampl transfer call blindwhen alreadi call youwil option transfer itthi could foundbehind buttonwhen use featureskyp ask select acontact search one bytyp name personif person severalphon number beabl select number youwish call overviewanoth option typeth number directli thisinput box press transfer case person receivingth call cours invitedthen sheanswer call exit thecal leav twoparti call togetherso that first type oftransf transfer call blindthat say havenot consult personbefor transfer callso direct transferth second option youar alreadi call thatyou also call addsomeon call thenhang order toleav two parti callin case ill doi use invit peoplebutton add person toth call that progressther small windowwhich ask select theperson want addor ill number directlyth third person invitedand accept thecal appear see herenow three us areparticip callmean havea threeway discussionnow order leavethes two peopl togeth youjust need hang upand leav callthi termin thecal complet thetwo peopl stay togeth willb abl continu conversationfin third optiontransf call prior consultationwhen call afirst parti simplyiniti second call via theskyp window like examplethi enabl toput first call holdwhen second personansw introduc theperson explain thereason call transferredthi method allow toswitch one anoth iffor exampl persondo much time andwant know thecal urgent noti alway return firstcal put second call holdto clarifi request littlediscuss reason call etci resum calluntil person accept thetransf casei use transferbutton found hereth window let youselect contact opensi abl choos thecurr call transfer destinationit person amcurr talk toi select thisperson transfer callonc hang two partieswil remain togeth callw look three way totransf call skype busi
Conference call,"Conference calls. In thisvideo on conference calls, wewill see how toparticipate in a conference call withseveral people at the same time.When you are talking to afirst contact, you will be ableto invite other participants byusing the Invite More People button.I'll just press this button toadd or call a second contact.This action now allows thethree of us to participate inthe same telephoneconversation. It is possible to perform the steps severaltimes, so long as the systemallows it and I can, therefore,call, for example, a fourth participant.Now that everyone is present,we can begin our conference call.I have a few options when itcomes to managing the conference call.One of these options is touse the Participants button tobe able to see who wasparticipating in the call.All the participants in theconference call are listed here.It is possible to performcertain actions: for example,you can mute aparticipant by making a simple rightclick on their name.If, for example, one personis speaking from somewherewith a lot of backgroundnoise, I can simply disable hisor her remote microphone inorder to prevent noise pollution.It is then possible toturn it on again remotely.Another feature is that ifsomeone is no longer able toparticipate or wishes toleave the conference call, theycan either simply leave theconference call by hangingup, or I can remove thisperson using this option, sothat only three ofus continue the call.Finally, if you wish toleave the conference callyourself, even if you are theinitiator or organiser,you can leave or hang up.This will still allow theother participants to stay andcontinue the call without you.So now, you have seen how toinitiate and manage a conference call.",confer call thisvideo confer call wewil see toparticip confer call withsever peopl timewhen talk afirst contact ableto invit particip byus invit peopl buttonil press button toadd call second contactthi action allow thethre us particip inth telephoneconvers possibl perform step severaltim long systemallow thereforecal exampl fourth participantnow everyon presentw begin confer calli option itcom manag confer callon option tous particip button tobe abl see wasparticip callal particip theconfer call list hereit possibl performcertain action exampley mute aparticip make simpl rightclick nameif exampl one personi speak somewherewith lot backgroundnois simpli disabl hisor remot microphon inord prevent nois pollutionit possibl toturn remotelyanoth featur ifsomeon longer abl toparticip wish toleav confer call theycan either simpli leav theconfer call hangingup remov thisperson use option sothat three ofu continu callfin wish toleav confer callyourself even theiniti organisery leav hang upthi still allow theother particip stay andcontinu call without youso seen toiniti manag confer call
Forwarding your calls,"Forwarding your calls.With Skype for Businessset-up to make phone calls, youhave the option, as with aconventional telephone system,to forward your calls to anotherline, another telephone number.A menu for managing call forwardingis here at the bottom of the interface.In my case, callforwarding is disabled on my line.By opening this littlelist, we will open all optionsthat are related to call forwarding.The first option is tochoose a destination for calls.The first thing that maybe useful is the option offorwarding a call to voicemail.

Following up missed calls,"Missed calls.In this video,we'll look at how to follow upyour missed callsin Skype for business.You have a tab thatenables you to view your entirehistory either byconversations or by phone calls.In this tab,you will find all activityfrom your Skype and everythingthat you have received in theway of calls or conversations.When you have missed aconversation or a telephone callyou will receive alittle indication here.A little ""1"" here lets meknow that I have missed aconversation or telephone call.It's very simple to view this.I click on this tab and I canclearly see that I received a missed call.It's the same for messaging.If I have a new voicemail onmy phone, I can also find anotification in the form ofa telephone icon that willlet me know at a glancethat I have a new message.If I receive just onenotification in the history tab, it means I have missed a call butnot necessarily a related message.On the other hand,if I have both, I'mgoing to receive anotification for the missed call andat the same time the messagecorresponding to the missed call.Filters are availablein this history tab.If I click on All I'll beable to see all the calls thathave been made, received ormissed as well as the conversations.Everything in this listwill be all jumbled up.Of course, there isthe possibility to filterconversations and telephonecalls that are classed as missed.The last filter will allowyou to view all telephonecalls that are received or missed.Using this list, itis quite possible toinitiate certain actionsby hovering over an icon.You will be able to make acall to this correspondent orto initiate other actionssuch as viewing the businesscard in order to have moreinformation about whether thisperson is listed in adirectory, for example.In terms of messagingit's the same principle.We'll click on telephone inorder to check the voicemailwith all the messages available,displayed in the lower part of the window.I can use this listto check my messages.To do so, I simplyhover over the icon or right-click.Right clickinggives you a few more optionssuch as the possibilityof reading the message.I can make a call from thislist to this person or starta video call, for example.Or even add the person to mycontacts if I do nothave them saved already.Once you have read yourmessages, you will also have theoption of deleting them.We have seen how to view andmanage messages from thevoicemail but this little iconon the right of the interfaceprovides me with other options.By clicking on this littlebutton you are shown threeoptions, includingcalling your voicemail.Once you have fullymastered the system, an importantstep is to customiseyour voicemail message.Finally, we have the abilityto configure the voicemail.This last option isinteresting because when you click ityou open your Outlook web appwhere you can configure somesettings for your voicemail.When you click on thisoption you will open the exactpage that corresponds tothe options in Outlookin the telephone section andin the voicemail tab.This page allows you tosave rules, enabling you tooptimally configure yourvoicemail or at least definewhat should happen with your callswhen you are busy or do not answer.It's a bit like the rulesfor mailboxes, here you can adddifferent rules byfirst naming them and byselecting criteria topersonalise the settings for theactions to be takenregarding your voicemail.One last thing to know,which may be important when itcomes to managing missedcalls and messages, is that youcan configure thesettings for transferring calls.Including the timeafter which a call should betransferred to yourvoicemail. By default, it is set to twenty seconds.That is to say, aftertwenty seconds I will be notifiedand if I do not answer,the call will betransferred to voicemail.This time can becustomised by opening this list.You can have at last for upto a minute before the callis redirected to voicemail.We have seen all the optionsregarding voicemail and how to viewall made and received missed calls.",miss callsin videowel look follow upyour miss callsin skype businessy tab thaten view entirehistori either byconvers phone callsin tabyou find activityfrom skype everythingthat receiv theway call conversationswhen miss aconvers telephon callyou receiv alittl indic herea littl 1 let meknow miss aconvers telephon callit simpl view thisi click tab canclearli see receiv miss callit messagingif new voicemail onmi phone also find anotif form ofa telephon icon willlet know glancethat new messageif receiv onenotif histori tab mean miss call butnot necessarili relat messageon handif imgo receiv anotif miss call andat time messagecorrespond miss callfilt availablein histori tabif click ill beabl see call thathav made receiv ormiss well conversationseveryth listwil jumbl upof cours isth possibl filterconvers telephonecal class missedth last filter allowy view telephonecal receiv missedus list iti quit possibl toiniti certain actionsbi hover icony abl make acal correspond orto initi actionssuch view businesscard order moreinform whether thisperson list adirectori examplein term messagingit principlewel click telephon inord check voicemailwith messag availabledisplay lower part windowi use listto check messagesto simplyhov icon rightclickright clickingg optionssuch possibilityof read messagei make call thislist person starta video call exampleor even add person mycontact nothav save alreadyonc read yourmessag also theoption delet themw seen view andmanag messag thevoicemail littl iconon right interfaceprovid optionsbi click littlebutton shown threeoption includingcal voicemailonc fullymast system importantstep customiseyour voicemail messagefin abilityto configur voicemailthi last option isinterest click ityou open outlook web appwher configur someset voicemailwhen click thisopt open exactpag correspond toth option outlookin telephon section andin voicemail tabthi page allow tosav rule enabl tooptim configur yourvoicemail least definewhat happen callswhen busi answerit bit like rulesfor mailbox adddiffer rule byfirst name byselect criteria topersonalis set theaction takenregard voicemailon last thing knowwhich may import itcom manag missedcal messag youcan configur theset transfer callsinclud timeaft call betransf yourvoicemail default set twenti secondsthat say aftertwenti second notifiedand answerth call betransf voicemailthi time becustomis open listyou last upto minut calli redirect voicemailw seen optionsregard voicemail viewal made receiv miss call
Discovering the interface,"Discovering the interface.Hello and welcome to this tutorial on Project Online.In this section, we will discover the software interface.Together we will look at how to consult a list ofprojects and key information relating to projects,how to work from the Gantt charts available,how to define and manage a number of licenses for your employeesand lastly how to access the various resources in particular usingthe library of the documents which is assigned to each project.To get started, access the portal and open the project online software.Once the software is opened, you will be taken directly to the project center.Here, you will be able to see exactly what I have described in the introduction.Let's look together at how to consult key information for your projects.In the center of the screen, you will see the complete list of projects.They are centralized in Project Online.First, you have the name of the project and then the information relating to it.Information about the start and end dates,the completion rate, the plan duration,the work already completed and the person who manages the project as the owner.For information purposes,you also have the last dates of the latest publications that have been made.Now let's look at how to monitor the coordination ofprojects in comparison to each other and their progress.For this, you can use the column separator in the second part of the screen.You can adjust the size of each view and you can also see the progress of each project,each project in relation to othersbut also the internal evaluations of projects,the progress rate for each project being indicated with a darker bar.If you need to change the view, go to the ribbon.Under the project's tab, you have zoom lenses that allowyou to increase or decrease the size of the view for maximum visibility.Of course not everyone can access any project.Let's take a look at how to grant and manage a number ofpermissions involving projects.At the side, I will bring up my list of projects,I will select my project and, still using the ribbon,grant permissions for the project from here.Let's see what kind of permissions these could be.You can grant permissions as a member,those invited as a member will be able to contribute and participateactively in the implementation of the project.You can grant permissions only as a visitor,in this case visitors will only have the right to read or consult the document.The rights as an owner grant total control of a project to a person.How can these permissions be granted?Use the icon that is here.The window that appears will be familiar to you.Just fill in the address of the person with whomyou would like to share the project and write a message forthat person if you have specific information you wish to send.By displaying the options, you can once again findthe permission levels available and here you will be able tochange the permission level as you require.Full control, read only, modification.You can configure all of this as you desire depending on the people involved.When all of this is done, you can click Share.In Shared with, you have the list of people who sharethe same project with you.

Customising the interface,"Customizing the interface.Hello and welcome to this tutorial on Project Online.In this section, we will look at the customization of the different possible displays.First we'll look at how to set up the Quick Launch menu.We will then look at the various displays, filters andcombinations available for obtaining the information relevant to your project.Let's see how to navigate Project Online smoothlyand set up the navigation pane.The navigation pane on the left of your screen offersa number of functions that will be useful for managing your project.For example, if you want to view all of your resources,the function immediately appears here in the navigation pane.You can modify your navigation pane from the Edit links function,the different fields will appear in this overviewand checkboxes will ensure that functions are available in the navigation menu.If you un-tick them, they will simply be hidden in the Quick Launch menu.You now want to change the display to obtain important information.Let's focus on costs here and see how to obtain this display.In the ribbon, I'll go to the data group where I'll have the various display options.I have an overview of all the various projectsbut I will ask that the information containing the assignments cost be displayed.A new view appears and displays the fields common to my project,start and finish, and then the various informationrelating to the cost of the different projects will appear.I now want to make the projects in my portfolio visible.Here's the function that will allow you to filter the information.Just below the display function, you have the filter function.I'm going to ask that the information be filtered and filtered by owner.I will indicate the name I want to find in order to nowretrieve the various projects managed by this person.Here are the two projects owned by this person.To complete this tutorial, let's see how to refinethe display of your projects and the opportunities actively offered by Project Online.Here you have the Group by function,a number of combinations will be offereddepending on the displays requested.For example, I'll remove the filters to retrieve all ofmy projects and I will ask who is managing which project.I would make a grouping according to the owner of various projects.The projects have been grouped and I know instantly who manages which project.You have the knowledge required for managing the main displays in Project Onlinewith dynamic displays, groupings and filters,not to mention the Quick Launch menu that will allow you to get the information you want.",custom interfacehello welcom tutori project onlinein section look custom differ possibl displaysfirst well look set quick launch menuw look variou display filter andcombin avail obtain inform relev projectlet see navig project onlin smoothlyand set navig paneth navig pane left screen offersa number function use manag projectfor exampl want view resourcesth function immedi appear navig paney modifi navig pane edit link functionth differ field appear overviewand checkbox ensur function avail navig menuif untick simpli hidden quick launch menuy want chang display obtain import informationlet focu cost see obtain displayin ribbon ill go data group ill variou display optionsi overview variou projectsbut ask inform contain assign cost displayeda new view appear display field common projectstart finish variou informationrel cost differ project appeari want make project portfolio visibleher function allow filter informationjust display function filter functionim go ask inform filter filter owneri indic name want find order nowretriev variou project manag personher two project own personto complet tutori let see refineth display project opportun activ offer project onlineher group functiona number combin offereddepend display requestedfor exampl ill remov filter retriev ofmi project ask manag projecti would make group accord owner variou projectsth project group know instantli manag projecty knowledg requir manag main display project onlinewith dynam display group filtersnot mention quick launch menu allow get inform want
Creating the project tasks,"Creating the project tasks.Hello and welcome to this tutorial on Project Online.In this section, we will show you how to create project tasks.Project Online is not a software that just simply liststhe various activities referred to as project tasks.It also enables them to be organized by allowing you toplan and optimize the use of resources.It is important that the majority of these are defined before a project begins.In this tutorial, we will seehow to enter a task, what the different types of tasks there are,how to prioritize them, how to ensure thatthey are monitored, how to display a timeline and how toensure the publication of these various tasks.Of course, a project implies that certain actions areinterrelated or that starting a task requires a previous task to be completed.Let's see how all of this is indicated in Project Online.In my project, I can indicate the different tasks that I want to implement.There are two types of tasks: summary tasks and subtasks,which can complement the information relating to a more generic task.I'm going to add a task that I will subordinate to the design,e.g., content of training recommendation and below contentof training validation.Both of these tasks are subordinate to the first.I'm going to use this Indent function in the ribbon.Now there are two tasks that are subordinated to the design task.For each project activity or task, you will need toprovide a certain amount of information: who, when, how much, how long.Here's how to indicate the important indicators for your project.By using different fields, I can easily indicate everything.I can determine the content of the training in one day.I will do this by using the calendar and will select the data that suits me.My task will start on the third and will be completed on the same day.How much working time will I be required to spend completing it?This task requires two hours of work.I can do precisely the same for the validation of the training content.I'll do it on the fourthand it will take one hour of work.I have provided all the information relating to each of my tasks.I note that in the design task, which is a generic taskor a summary task, the total hours and days allotted fromthe various subtasks have been calculated.To ensure the project is properly monitored and to obtainreliable information, it is essential that each taskindicates the level of completion.Project Online then calculates the impact of this rate on the entire project.Let's see how to indicate this and observe the effects.Right here, we see that this task has been fully completed.I must therefore indicate 100%.In contrast to this, I have presented my validation,but I've not yet had a response.It is validated, but only up to 50%,so I indicate 50% in this column.Here I have my alpha project, which has progressed.One final element, which may be important when a taskrequires a preceding activity to be completed in order tobe able to start is to use the concept of predecessors.Let's see how this is indicated in Project Online.Here you have a predecessor field and if you want tasknumber 5 to begin when task number 3 has been implemented,you simply indicate so to task number 5with number 3 as a reference point.You have the numbers of tasks in front of each of them.Once validated, you can see here that the gunshotindicates that this task cannot begin until task number 3 is completed.You can also use the timeline view in order to obtain more visibility.Now let's look at how to add your tasks to this view and configure them as needed.I shall very simply add my two design tasksto my timeline view, which is located right here.I shall go into Tasks in the ribbon and shall add to timeline.My tasks have just been added.I select the following.I add it to the timeline and it has now been added.Once your tasks have been developed, you should validate all the information.Still inside the ribbon, you must saveand then do not forget to publish in order to make the latest updates public.All of these actions are requiredin order to validate all of your closed data.And now you have the means to implement the various tasks,subordinating them relative to each other,organizing them so as to retain consistency throughout your projectand managing it under the best conditions.",creat project taskshello welcom tutori

Teams and channels,"You are a team leader andyou would like to encourage communication within your projects in a subject-oriented manner.Email does not seem tobe the solution for you.Instant messaging is very practical, but you do not control the flow and youdo not keep any history… You wish to be able to come backon conversations in order tocomment on it, participate andthus capitalize on the knowledge.How do you keep your team's conversations and easily find back shared content? How do you centralize all the conversations in a single space while keeping the thematic separation?How do you know who answers what?Establishing a system thatfacilitates communication andthe flow of ideas in afree and organized way is key.Microsoft Teams is basedon instant messaging, and it allows you to create severalthreads for the same projectand to ensure a good traceabilityof all the discussions realized.In your team's work space, you cancreate as many channels as you want.They allow you to structureyour team's work and discussions.You can separate themaccording to tasks, name of services, project phases, etc. The advantage of this separation is to help you find yourself more easily.Let us imagine forexample that a new employee justjoined your team and you want him to work on a topic already started by your team. You will not lose a day to explain the work to him.Just give him access to the channels associated to this subject so that he can see what has been exchanged already and the files shared by your team.He can also use thesearch box below the team list.By checking the discussionhistory, a message has caught his attention and he wants to get more information.For this, he simply needsto click on Reply above the message in order towrite his question.And in this way, these messageswill remain in the conversation.Next, he can use the SaveThis Message function to savethis part of the conversation so thathe can follow it and find it easily.To view all saved messages, click onyour profile image and then on Saved.After a while, he noticedthat his message was not followed up, probably because theright person did not see his message.To attract this person's attention.just mention his orher name after the add symbol. Be aware that he canprivately contact the personat any time if heor she is available.For example, I see thatLaurent is now available.I click on Chat in the mainmenu, then on the New chat button and I finishby entering his name.To add more people to thisconversation, just add their name to the list.In addition, if necessary,he can switch from a writtenconversation to a video meetingby clicking the video call button.Finally, you can join aconversation from your computerand continue it on any other mobile devices thereby always keeping you posted. This demonstration allowed bus to see the following enefits: thanks to Teams, you can centralize all the conversations in a single personalized and secure space.You have permanent communication threads on which you can easily return whenever youwish to view the discussion history and the fileshared by your team.Teams has rendered your teamconversations more productive and focused.",team leader andyou would like encourag commun within project subjectori manneremail seem tobe solut youinstant messag practic control flow youdo keep histori wish abl come backon convers order tocom particip andthu capit knowledgehow keep team convers easili find back share content central convers singl space keep themat separationhow know answer whatestablish system thatfacilit commun andth flow idea afre organ way keymicrosoft team basedon instant messag allow creat severalthread projectand ensur good traceabilityof discuss realizedin team work space cancreat mani channel wantthey allow structureyour team work discussionsy separ themaccord task name servic project phase etc advantag separ help find easilylet us imagin forexampl new employe justjoin team want work topic alreadi start team lose day explain work himjust give access channel associ subject see exchang alreadi file share teamh also use thesearch box team listbi check discussionhistori messag caught attent want get informationfor simpli needsto click repli messag order towrit questionand way messageswil remain conversationnext use savethi messag function savethi part convers thath follow find easilyto view save messag click onyour profil imag savedaft noticedthat messag follow probabl theright person see messageto attract person attentionjust mention orher name add symbol awar canpriv contact personat time heor availablefor exampl see thatlaur availablei click chat mainmenu new chat button finishbi enter nameto add peopl thisconvers add name listin addit necessaryh switch writtenconvers video meetingbi click video call buttonfin join aconvers computerand continu mobil devic therebi alway keep post demonstr allow bu see follow enefit thank team central convers singl person secur spacey perman commun thread easili return whenev youwish view discuss histori fileshar teamteam render teamconvers product focus

Custom margin - Headers and footers,"Now we're going to change marginsfor your headers and footers.In a previous video we changed our marginsso that the right margin is fairly wide,but take a look at whathappened to this document.Down here in the lower right of the page,we've got our page number here,but that looks a little odd.We're used to seeing page numbersnestled into the right-handcorner of a page like this.How do we get this page number over there?How do we change the margin of this footerso that this page numberis in the right place?Well, we double-click the footer areaand that makes thefooter the active portionof the document that we're editing.And to change the margin,we're going to press Ctrl Ato select all the content in the footer.And then we're going to dragthis right indent markerabout an inch from the page.And there.We'll double-click thenormal area of the documentto get out of the footer editing modeand our page numbersare in the right place.And you'll see that those are repeatedon each page of this document here.Now, what if we need to change the header?We can change that header margin, too.We do the same thing.We double-click the header area.We press Ctrl A to selecteverything inside thereand then we drag that right indent markerabout an inch from the edge of the page.And when we're done, we double-clickthe rest of the document.And there, we've changed themargin of the header, as well.",go chang marginsfor header footersin previou video chang marginsso right margin fairli widebut take look whathappen documentdown lower right pagewev got page number herebut look littl oddwer use see page numbersnestl righthandcorn page like thishow get page number therehow chang margin footerso page numberi right placewel doubleclick footer areaand make thefoot activ portionof document editingand chang marginwer go press ctrl ato select content footerand go dragthi right indent markerabout inch pageand therewel doubleclick thenorm area documentto get footer edit modeand page numbersar right placeand youll see repeatedon page document herenow need chang headerw chang header margin toow thingw doubleclick header areaw press ctrl selecteveryth insid thereand drag right indent markerabout inch edg pageand done doubleclickth rest documentand weve chang themargin header well
Use landscape and portrait orientation,"When you're deciding how to frame a picture,you use a vertical or portraitorientation for things likeportraits and othervertically-oriented subjects,and use a horizontal orlandscape orientationfor horizontal subjects like a landscape.It's the same with Word.By default, a documentuses portrait orientationbecause most documents are primarily text,and text works well inthis vertical format.But if your document containssomething that's essentially horizontal,like tables with a lot of columns,you can change theorientation to landscape.Go to the Layout tab,click Orientation and Landscape,and the content in thedocument turns 90 degrees.Now, with more horizontal space,you can adjust the column widthsto give your table more breathing room.However, there is another way.You can create a document witha mix of portrait and landscape pages.To learn more about that,right-click the Table Selection iconand choose Table Properties.On the Table tab, under Text wrapping,make sure None is selected and click OK.Next, go to the Layout taband, in the Page Setup group,click the Dialog Box Launcher.This is where to go ifyou want to get intoall the details of pagesetup in one place.Margins, Paper, Layout,it's all right here.On the Margins tab, under Orientation,click Landscape, then go down hereand click the arrow next to Apply toand choose Select a text.Now, the only thing thatwill change to landscapeis the selected text.Click OK.The table is now in landscapeorientation on its own page.And when we scroll to another page,you can see that the rest of the documentis still in portrait orientation.Now, we can go back to the tableand adjust the column widthsto stretch the table outto fit nicely on the page.So, what exactly is going on here?First, go to the View taband let's click Multiple Pages.Now you can see the landscape pagein the same view with the portrait pages.Next, go to the Home taband click Show/Hide Paragraph Marks.And there's the secret to mixingportrait and landscape in one document.Section Break, Next Page.I'll zoom back a bit.When we applied landscapeto just the selected text,Word added section breaksbefore and after the table.This placed the table in its own sectionon a page by itself.Then, Word was able to changejust that page to landscape.By the way, section breaks also allow youto change the margins on landscape pageswithout affecting therest of the document.You can add the same typeof section break manuallywhenever you want to change the layoutor formatting of a page or pagesby going to the Layouttab and clicking Breaks.Then go down to SectionBreaks and click Next Page.After you use multiple pageorientations in marginsto create the frames for your document,you can think about the best wayto lay out your content within the frames.",your decid frame picturey use vertic portraitorient thing likeportrait otherverticallyori subjectsand use horizont orlandscap orientationfor horizont subject like landscapeit wordbi default documentus portrait orientationbecaus document primarili textand text work well inthi vertic formatbut document containssometh that essenti horizontallik tabl lot columnsy chang theorient landscapego layout tabclick orient landscapeand content thedocu turn 90 degreesnow horizont spacey adjust column widthsto give tabl breath roomhowev anoth wayyou creat document witha mix portrait landscap pagesto learn thatrightclick tabl select iconand choos tabl propertieson tabl tab text wrappingmak sure none select click oknext go layout taband page setup groupclick dialog box launcherthi go ifyou want get intoal detail pagesetup one placemargin paper layoutit right hereon margin tab orientationclick landscap go hereand click arrow next appli toand choos select textnow thing thatwil chang landscapei select textclick okth tabl landscapeorient pageand scroll anoth pagey see rest documenti still portrait orientationnow go back tableand adjust column widthsto stretch tabl outto fit nice pageso exactli go herefirst go view taband let click multipl pagesnow see landscap pagein view portrait pagesnext go home taband click showhid paragraph marksand there secret mixingportrait landscap one documentsect break next pageil zoom back bitwhen appli landscapeto select textword ad section breaksbefor tablethi place tabl sectionon page itselfthen word abl changejust page landscapebi way section break also allow youto chang margin landscap pageswithout affect therest documenty add typeof section break manuallywhenev want chang layoutor format page pagesbi go layouttab click breaksthen go sectionbreak click next pageaft use multipl pageorient marginsto creat frame documenty think best wayto lay content within frame
Design considerations for orientation,"After you add pageswith different orientationsto your document,you can start thinkingabout design issues.First, what do you do withyour headers and footers?You see, when you add a landscape page,the header and footer goto the top and bottom,just like they're supposed to.But think about how thereader will view the page.With all the pagesprinted out and stapled,the header and footeron the landscape pageappear sideways on the right and left.If you don't prefer that look,here are some things you can try.First, we need to unlink theheader so we can change itwithout changing all the other headers.Let's click view multiple pagesto change to multiple page viewso it's easier to see what's going on.Now, double-click the headerin the landscape page.Because we added the headerbefore we changed theorientation of the page,this box says same as previous,which means that this header is the sameas the header on the previous page.Another way you can tell is by going tothe header and footers tool design taband looking at the linkto previous button.If it's selected like it is now,that means the header is linked toor the same as the previous page.If we make a change in one header,like delete the text, thetext is deleted in allthe headers because they're linked.I'll press control Zto bring the text back.So here's what we needto do so we can changethe header on just this page.With the header selected,click link to previousto turn off linking.And the box that says sameas previous goes away.Click next to move to the pageafter the landscape page, and turn offlink to previous here, too.Now we can select the headeron the landscape page,and press delete.And the other headers are unaffected.If your pages also have footers,click go to footer, andturn off linking there, too.",add pageswith differ orientationsto documenty start thinkingabout design issuesfirst withyour header footersy see add landscap pageth header footer goto top bottomjust like theyr suppos tobut think theread view pagewith pagesprint stapledth header footeron landscap pageappear sideway right leftif dont prefer lookher thing tryfirst need unlink thehead chang itwithout chang headerslet click view multipl pagesto chang multipl page viewso easier see what go onnow doubleclick headerin landscap pagebecaus ad headerbefor chang theorient pagethi box say previouswhich mean header samea header previou pageanoth way tell go toth header footer tool design taband look linkto previou buttonif select like nowthat mean header link toor previou pageif make chang one headerlik delet text thetext delet allth header theyr linkedil press control zto bring text backso here needto changeth header pagewith header selectedclick link previousto turn linkingand box say samea previou goe awayclick next move pageaft landscap page turn offlink previou toonow select headeron landscap pageand press deleteand header unaffectedif page also footersclick go footer andturn link
Insert and customize a footnote,"In this series of videos,we're gonna cover footnotes.Let's start by showingyou how to insert one.I'm going to click my cursor to the rightof the text that I wannaadd a footnote for.And then up here on the 'References' tab,I'm going to click 'Insert Footnote.'Now, that does two things.That puts a little superscriptnumber, of course, up here.That's great, and thendown here at the bottomof that page we have a notes area,where we can type the citationor whatever we want toin this footnote area.Footnotes are put at the bottomof the page that they're on.Here's the footnote numberhere, the superscript three.And the correspondingis at the bottom of this page here.Okay, here's that corresponding footnote.Now, what if you want to changethe location of a footnote?For example, let's sayyou wanted this footnoteto be at the end of the document.That's usually called an endnote.If you inserted an endnote,you could have done thatby clicking the 'Insert Endnote' button,but you probably didn't do that.You'd probably want to convertyour footnotes to endnotes.So, we'll go ahead and do that.What you do is you right-click a footnoteand you choose 'Convert to Endnote.'And then you'll scroll down hereand you'll see that the footnoteis definitely now an endnote.It's at the end of the document.Now, you probably don't want a mixof footnotes and endnotesin your document,so I'm gonna undo that andI'm gonna show you that you can convert all your footnotesto endnotes in one go.So I'll go ahead andright-click that note area,click 'Note Options,' and thenover here click 'Convert.'And 'Convert All Footnotes to Endnotes,'that's exactly what wewant, so we'll click 'OK.'And then close.And then when we scroll to the bottomyou can see all your footnotesare now endnotes, okay?So, what if you wanna change the numberingfor your footnotes or endnotes?For example, we've got footnoteone, two, and three here,but maybe we wanna use letters instead.Maybe we wanna use an A, B, or C,or maybe we wanna use somesymbols, like an asterisk.You can do that.Go ahead and justright-click your notes areaand click 'Note Options.'And then over here on theright under 'Number Format,'choose the options you want.I'm gonna choose A, B, and C,but you could alsochoose these options hereor you could choose these symbols here.Those are very common.I'll click there and click'Apply,' and there we go.We've got our numberingsystem changed to A, B, and c.And then it's all throughout the documentthat that change occurred.So we've got the A here, kay.We've got the B here and the C right here.So, we've changed the footnote numbering,but what about the sizeof that little footnote?Can we change that?And what about the text down here?Can we change the way this text looks?Can it be bigger?Can it be a different font?Can it have different spacing?It sure can and we'll showyou how in the next video.",seri videoswer gon na cover footnoteslet start showingy insert oneim go click cursor rightof text wannaadd footnot forand refer tabim go click insert footnotenow two thingsthat put littl superscriptnumb cours herethat great thendown bottomof page note areawher type citationor whatev want toin footnot areafootnot put bottomof page theyr onher footnot numberher superscript threeand correspondingi bottom page hereokay here correspond footnotenow want changeth locat footnotefor exampl let sayyou want footnoteto end documentthat usual call endnoteif insert endnotey could done thatbi click insert endnot buttonbut probabl didnt thatyoud probabl want convertyour footnot endnotesso well go ahead thatwhat rightclick footnoteand choos convert endnoteand youll scroll hereand youll see footnotei definit endnoteit end documentnow probabl dont want mixof footnot endnotesin documentso im gon na undo andim gon na show convert footnotesto endnot one goso ill go ahead andrightclick note areaclick note option thenov click convertand convert footnot endnotesthat exactli wewant well click okand closeand scroll bottomy see footnotesar endnot okayso wan na chang numberingfor footnot endnotesfor exampl weve got footnoteon two three herebut mayb wan na use letter insteadmayb wan na use b cor mayb wan na use somesymbol like asterisky thatgo ahead justrightclick note areaand click note optionsand theright number formatchoos option wantim gon na choos b cbut could alsochoos option hereor could choos symbol herethos commonil click clickappli gowev got numberingsystem chang b cand throughout documentthat chang occurredso weve got kaywev got b c right hereso weve chang footnot numberingbut sizeof littl footnotecan chang thatand text herecan chang way text lookscan biggercan differ fontcan differ spacingit sure well showyou next video
"Change footnote font, size, and formatting","Even inserted footnotes, but maybe you don't like the size of the number so for example, we have a little superscript 3. Here, maybe you want that footnote number 2 be bigger or perhaps you don't want to use superscript or maybe this text down here. You want it to look a little different. Maybe you want to change the font or the size or the spacing you can do all that.And the way we do that as we use word styles. Now, if you've used word styles before or even if you haven't. They're up here on the home tab and you've got your heading styles up here. But word use the styles to display this little footnote and to make this text look good down here in your notes paint.It uses some behind the scenes styles for that, so to get to those behind the scenes. Styles were going to go to this little arrow and we're going to go down here to this manage styles button.And then we want to look for the footnote reference style. So we're going to go ahead and choose alphabetical here and then find it in here there it is footnote reference.OK, we're going to modify that style and we're going to modify the font. Incidentally, this is where you can turn off that superscript setting if you don't want your numbers raised, but I happen to like that, so that's fine. I just want to make my superscript numbers bigger so I'll choose that setting there and click OK and then OK again and then with the fine.Will see here that the superscript numbers are now bigger and you might even say they're a little more readable OK now? What if you want to change. This text here? How do you do that? How do you change the style of that again you go to the manage styles button and then because we selected that footnote text that particular style.Good for you in this dialog box, so that makes it handy. You don't have to hunt around for the right style and then you can click modify format font like we did before and then you could change the font here. If you want. I'm going to choose Courier new and I'm going to make it italic and then.I'll keep the size the same, that's fine click OK and then I'll change the paragraph spacing here. I'll make it 1.5 lines and out of hanging indent too. But the hanging. Indent is going to do is it's going to move these second lines of this note text underneath the first one, so we'll click OK and.There we go, we've got now are note text in that Courier format and we've got our spacing and that hanging Indent. All working nicely so that's how to change your footnotes both the numbers and the explanatory text.",even insert footnot mayb dont like size number exampl littl superscript 3 mayb want footnot number 2 bigger perhap dont want use superscript mayb text want look littl differ mayb want chang font size space thatand way use word style youv use word style even havent theyr home tab youv got head style word use style display littl footnot make text look good note paintit use behind scene style get behind scene style go go littl arrow go go manag style buttonand want look footnot refer style go go ahead choos alphabet find footnot referenceok go modifi style go modifi font incident turn superscript set dont want number rais happen like that fine want make superscript number bigger ill choos set click ok ok finewil see superscript number bigger might even say theyr littl readabl ok want chang text chang style go manag style button select footnot text particular stylegood dialog box make handi dont hunt around right style click modifi format font like could chang font want im go choos courier new im go make ital thenil keep size that fine click ok ill chang paragraph space ill make 15 line hang indent hang indent go go move second line note text underneath first one well click ok andther go weve got note text courier format weve got space hang indent work nice that chang footnot number explanatori text
Styles,"Formatting your documentsis an important step.Generally, you use the fontand paragraph group iconson the home tab to format a piece of text,and then you use the brush tool,that will enable youto copy the formatting,and reproduce it on another piece of text.But, it becomes tedious whenworking on a long document,and these two portions oftext are not contiguous.Fortunately, MS Word hasa very useful featureto solve this kind ofproblem called styles.A style brings togethervarious formatting featuressuch as font size, font color, alignment,and as many other features as necessary.Even if you think you havenever used style, you're wrong.Any text you enter in Word, has a style.The default style is normal.Several pre-defined styles are availablein the style group on the home tab.A number of directly accessible stylesdepends on the width of the window.The width of the window allowsdirect access to six styles.To access the other styles,simply click the more iconin the style group.To apply a style is very easy.All you have to do is select a text,then you choose the style to apply.Or, just click on a paragraph,and choose the style you want.Take note that at any timeyou can delete a styleby selecting the text, or by clickingin the relevant paragraph,then the more icon in the style group,and choosing the clear formatting command.Finally, to know thestyle used in a paragraph,just click on it, andthe style in questionappears in the stylegallery of the style group.If the style is not visible, you mayhave to click the scrollarrows until the style appears.Go to the second video on stylesto learn how to edit styles.",format documentsi import stepgener use fontand paragraph group iconson home tab format piec textand use brush toolthat enabl youto copi formattingand reproduc anoth piec textbut becom tediou whenwork long documentand two portion oftext contiguousfortun ms word hasa use featureto solv kind ofproblem call stylesa style bring togethervari format featuressuch font size font color alignmentand mani featur necessaryeven think havenev use style your wrongani text enter word styleth default style normalsever predefin style availablein style group home taba number directli access stylesdepend width windowth width window allowsdirect access six stylesto access stylessimpli click iconin style groupto appli style easyal select textthen choos style applyor click paragraphand choos style wanttak note timey delet stylebi select text clickingin relev paragraphthen icon style groupand choos clear format commandfin know thestyl use paragraphjust click andth style questionappear stylegalleri style groupif style visibl mayhav click scrollarrow style appearsgo second video stylesto learn edit style

Collapsible headings,"Here's a handy trick you can usewhen you're having troublenavigating a large document.Right-click a heading,click Expand Collapse,and click Collapse All Headings.Now, with all the body text out of the wayit's easier to browsethrough the document.The collapsed headingsbecome something likea table of contents.To expand a section, click this triangle,and click it again tocollapse the section.If you want to see all the text,click Expand All Headings.If you can't collapse a heading,it's either because you'reusing an earlier version of Wordor the headings aren't formatted usingone of the build in heading styles.In this case, the writer added formattingto make it look like a heading,but as you can see in the Styles galleryit's still formatted as normal.To change that, chooseone of the heading styles.When you add a heading style,you add an outline level to the paragraph.And when you do that, the triangle appearsand you can collapse the heading.Collapsible headings are greatfor helping you read a document.But they can also be atimesaver when you're writing.While you're editing a document,you can select one ormore collapsed headingsto quickly copy, move ordelete whole sections.Or you can click and drag asection to a new location.When you're deciding how you want readersto navigate the document,you can lay it out withcollapsible headings in mind.For example, if you'redesigning the documentto be read on a computer,you can collapse all headings by default.Select all the headingsyou want to collapse,then on the Home tab,click the Paragraph dialog box launcher,and check Collapsed by default.Now when readers open the document,they can use the collapsed headingslike a table of contents,choose the section they want to readand click the triangle to expand it.Here's one last thing to keep in mind.Collapsed sections don't print,so typically you'll wantto expand all headingsbefore you print a document.But you could, for example,use Collapse and Expandto selectively print onlythe sections you want.Click the File tab and Print.Print Preview shows you exactlywhat will go to the printer.So collapsible headings can make it easierto read and quickly organize a document.But if you're really seriousabout organizing a document,you should look into Outline View.",here handi trick usewhen your troublenavig larg documentrightclick headingclick expand collapseand click collaps headingsnow bodi text wayit easier browsethrough documentth collaps headingsbecom someth likea tabl contentsto expand section click triangleand click tocollaps sectionif want see textclick expand headingsif cant collaps headingit either youreus earlier version wordor head arent format usingon build head stylesin case writer ad formattingto make look like headingbut see style galleryit still format normalto chang chooseon head styleswhen add head styley add outlin level paragraphand triangl appearsand collaps headingcollaps head greatfor help read documentbut also atimesav your writingwhil your edit documenty select one ormor collaps headingsto quickli copi move ordelet whole sectionsor click drag asect new locationwhen your decid want readersto navig documenty lay withcollaps head mindfor exampl youredesign documentto read computery collaps head defaultselect headingsy want collapsethen home tabclick paragraph dialog box launcherand check collaps defaultnow reader open documentthey use collaps headingslik tabl contentschoos section want readand click triangl expand ither one last thing keep mindcollaps section dont printso typic youll wantto expand headingsbefor print documentbut could exampleus collaps expandto select print onlyth section wantclick file tab printprint preview show exactlywhat go printerso collaps head make easierto read quickli organ documentbut your realli seriousabout organ documenty look outlin view
Introduction to Tables of Contents,"You can add a Table of Contents to a documentby typing all the charactersand page numbers manually.But not only is that a lot of work,you have to remember to updatethe table every time you make a change.In this video, we're going to skip the manual methodand focus on a much better way,automatic Tables of Contents.Here's how that works.First, go through the documentand add a heading with a heading stylewherever you want a Table of Contents entry.Then insert an automatic Table of Contentsand update it automaticallywhenever you make a change.Let's say we want the Table of Contentsto point to this summary.First, type a heading,then on the Home tab,open the Styles galleryand select the heading 1, 2 or 3 style.By default, any textthat you apply these styles towill show up as an entryin the Table of Contents.You decide how you want to usethe three heading levels.For example, you could useheading 1 for major parts or sections,heading 2 for chapters,and heading 3 for sub chapters.For this document,let's assign heading 1 to this heading.We can always change it later.Continue adding style headingsthroughout your document.In this last section,let's apply the heading 2 style to these subsections.When you're finished,click where you want to addthe Table of Contents.This is the easy part.Go to the References taband click Table of Contents,then choose which automatictable style you want and click.Word instantly creates a Table of Contentsbased on your styled headings,and it indents headings 2 & 3.That's pretty convenient.But it gets better.Let's say you continue working on the documentand add sections, move text around,remove pages or change headings.When it comes time to letother people see your document,all you have to do is clickUpdate Tableand choose whether to updatejust the page numbersor the entire table.That's all you have to know to insertan automatic Table of Contents.If you want to customize your table,click Table of Contentsand Custom Table of Contents.Look through the optionsand decide what you want to do.For example, you can show more levels.Then click optionsand change how you want to mapthe styles to each Table of Contents level.You can also modify the tableto work for print or the web or bothFor example, if you're distributingthe file on the web,readers can navigate the documentby clicking the linksinstead of using page numbers.There are more waysto customize a Table of Contents.",add tabl content documentbi type charactersand page number manuallybut lot workyou rememb updateth tabl everi time make changein video go skip manual methodand focu much better wayautomat tabl contentsher worksfirst go documentand add head head stylewherev want tabl content entrythen insert automat tabl contentsand updat automaticallywhenev make changelet say want tabl contentsto point summaryfirst type headingthen home tabopen style galleryand select head 1 2 3 stylebi default textthat appli style towil show entryin tabl contentsy decid want useth three head levelsfor exampl could usehead 1 major part sectionshead 2 chaptersand head 3 sub chaptersfor documentlet assign head 1 headingw alway chang latercontinu ad style headingsthroughout documentin last sectionlet appli head 2 style subsectionswhen your finishedclick want addth tabl contentsthi easi partgo refer taband click tabl contentsthen choos automatict style want clickword instantli creat tabl contentsbas style headingsand indent head 2 3that pretti convenientbut get betterlet say continu work documentand add section move text aroundremov page chang headingswhen come time letoth peopl see documental clickupd tableand choos whether updatejust page numbersor entir tablethat know insertan automat tabl contentsif want custom tableclick tabl contentsand custom tabl contentslook optionsand decid want dofor exampl show levelsthen click optionsand chang want mapth style tabl content levely also modifi tableto work print web bothfor exampl your distributingth file webread navig documentbi click linksinstead use page numbersther waysto custom tabl content
Take tables of contents (TOCs) to the next level,"In the previous course,Introduction to Table of Contents,we created a TOC by goingto the References tab,clicking Table of Contents,and selecting an automatictable of contents.Automatic tables of content,or TOCS, are easy to create,and you can update them automaticallywhenever you make achange to your document.All of you have to dois click Update Table,and Update Entire Table.In this course, we'llgo to the next level,and create a customautomatic table of contentsand then add our own formatting.Let's start by deleting the current TOC.The best way to do that isclick Table of Contents,and Remove Table of Contents.That way you can be surethat everything gets deleted.Now click where you want to add the TOC,open the Table of Contents gallery,and then click Custom Table of Contents.To build a custom table of contents,you need to tell Word what you wantand this is where you do it.You can decide whetherto include page numbers,and hyperlinks, things like that.Here you can choose a tab leader.That's what those dotsare called that go betweenthe table entry and page number.Let's change that to dashes.You can also change thenumber of outline levelsthat are shown.By default, a table ofcontents shows three levels,headings one, two, and three.Let's change that by changingthe number next to Show levels to four.Now for more options related to levels,click Options.This dialog box lets youdetermine what Word includesin the table of contents.By default, Word maps thefour levels we selectedto the first four headings.So in other words, when Wordbuilds our table of contents,it includes any text that's formatted withheading styles one through four,and it assigns them to TOClevels one through four.We could change this, for example,so that the heading five stylemapped to TOC level four.But we'll just stickwith the default for now.The last thing we'll do is makeone overall formatting adjustment.We'll do more in the next movie.By default, the table ofcontents uses whateverdocument formatting is includedin the document template.Then let's try one of the other formats.Click the Formats dropdown.The choices you see hereare roughly the same as thoseyou have on the Design tabin Document Formattingexcept these only affect thelook of the table of contents.Again, Preview shows youhow the different formats will look.For now, let's go with Formal.So let's see whathappens when we click OK.Word builds the automatictable of contentsfrom the four heading stylesbased on the options we chose.If you don't like the way something looks,go back to Custom Table of Contents,and make your changes.I think for formatting,I'll use Simple instead.Notice that when we select this format,the page numbers are nolonger right-aligned.So let's change that.Click OK, and click OK again to tellWord to remove the current tableand build a new one.So we've done some customizing.But what about makingspecific changes to

Add formatting to a TOC,"To add formattingto a table of contents,we'll start by adding it to one line.Let's select this lineand change the fontstyle to Century Gothicand the font color to Blue.Notice that after we add the formatting,the rest of the level onetext changes to match.So why does this happen?Well, Word uses three thingsto create an automatic table of contents.First, it takes the optionswe chose in movie one,grabs all the text in the documentwith a Heading 1 through 4 style,and finally formats thetable of contents textwith the builtin TOC stylesLet's take a look at those TOC styles.Click the Home tab and theStyles dialog box launcher.The Styles pane shows thebuiltin heading stylesused in the document.But down here, you'll seea bunch of these stylescalled TOC 1, TOC 2, and so on.These are the styles thatWord uses to format the textin the table of contents.By default, Headings 1,2, and 3 are formattedwith TOC styles 1, 2, and 3, respectively.So what all this means is that if you wantto change the format ofthe table of contents text,you need to change the TOC styles,and Word does that by defaultwhen you change one of the lines.That's why all the level one lines changedwhen we added the formatting,because the TOC 1 styleautomatically updated.Now I'll select this level two text,which I know is formattedwith the TOC 2 style.I'll remove the italicsand add bold,and the TOC 2 style automatically updates.Now, because the formattingwas changed in the TOC styles,we can right-click the table of contentsand update the table at any time,and we know that the formattingwill always be the same.Let's take it one step furtherand click the arrow nextto TOC 1 in the Styles paneand click Modify.This dialog box has the mostoptions for changing a style.Click Formatand Tabs,and let's change the tab stop.In a TOC style,the tab stop determines thelocation of the page number.Type 5,click Set,and clear the old tab stop.Now go to Paragraph,and let's add a left indent of one inchand click OK.We'll need to do the samething to the TOC 2 style.Click Modify,Format,and Tabs.Change the tab stop to 5,and clear the old tab stop.Also, click right align.Then, in Paragraph,add a left indent of 1.15 inches,a little bit farther to theright than the TOC 1 level.Click OKand OK.We'll also change the formattingfor the TOC 3 and 4 styles.So now you have total controlover the look of yourautomatic table of contents.",add formattingto tabl contentswel start ad one linelet select lineand chang fontstyl centuri gothicand font color bluenotic add formattingth rest level onetext chang matchso happenwel word use three thingsto creat automat tabl contentsfirst take optionsw chose movi onegrab text documentwith head 1 4 styleand final format thetabl content textwith builtin toc styleslet take look toc stylesclick home tab thestyl dialog box launcherth style pane show thebuiltin head stylesus documentbut youll seea bunch stylescal toc 1 toc 2 onthes style thatword use format textin tabl contentsbi default head 12 3 formattedwith toc style 1 2 3 respectivelyso mean wantto chang format ofth tabl content textyou need chang toc stylesand word defaultwhen chang one linesthat level one line changedwhen ad formattingbecaus toc 1 styleautomat updatednow ill select level two textwhich know formattedwith toc 2 styleil remov italicsand add boldand toc 2 style automat updatesnow formattingwa chang toc stylesw rightclick tabl contentsand updat tabl timeand know formattingwil alway samelet take one step furtherand click arrow nextto toc 1 style paneand click modifythi dialog box mostopt chang styleclick formatand tabsand let chang tab stopin toc styleth tab stop determin theloc page numbertyp 5click setand clear old tab stopnow go paragraphand let add left indent one inchand click okwel need sameth toc 2 styleclick modifyformatand tabschang tab stop 5and clear old tab stopalso click right alignthen paragraphadd left indent 115 inchesa littl bit farther theright toc 1 levelclick okand okwel also chang formattingfor toc 3 4 stylesso total controlov look yourautomat tabl content
Advanced tables of contents,"In this course we're gonnause some advanced techniquesto create a custom Tableof Contents, or ToC.Word creates a table of contentsfrom the headings in your document.And you can update it automaticallywhenever you make it change.But in this course we'regonna go even furtherand create the ultimatecustom automatic ToC,in which you have completecontrol over the contents.And the best place to startis with the Custom Style.Here's how that works.By default, Word buildsthe Table of Contentsfrom the text that has been formattedwith the built-in heading style.But you can also tell Wordto look for other styles,including ones that you create.In this document, let's say we want to addbrief descriptions like thisunder each heading entry.To do that we'll use a custom style.In this section let's select the textsthat we want to appearin the table of contents.As you can see the textis now formatted as normalwith the rest of the paragraph.Open the Styles Galleryand click Create a Style.We'll call our new style Summary.We could click here andmodify the formatting,but we won't, because we want it to lookjust like the rest of the paragraph.So click OK.Now all the text looks the same,but when you click onthe paragraph you seethat it actually contains two styles.So now we need to tell Wordto include our new style.Click ahead of the Table of Contents,then open the Table of Contents Gallery,and click Custom Tableof Contents, and Options.The first three heading styles are matchedto the first three ToC levels.Scroll down to the new styleand map it to Level 4 and click OK.The preview now shows thenew style under Heading 3.Click OK and Yesto replace the current table.The Summary text is added.The only thing left to do is to format itto look like a summary.Select the text in the table of contents.Open the Styles paneand scroll down the ToC Styles.When we added the text wemapped it to ToC level 4.So that means it's formattedwith the ToC four style.Click the arrow next toToC 4 and click Modify.Click Format and Paragraph,and indent the left andright margins 1.5 inches.And click OK.Let's also add italicsand click OK.Mapping Customs Styles to a ToC levelis pretty quick and easy way to controlwhat appears in the table of contents.",cours gonnaus advanc techniquesto creat custom tableof content tocword creat tabl contentsfrom head documentand updat automaticallywhenev make changebut cours weregonna go even furtherand creat ultimatecustom automat tocin completecontrol contentsand best place starti custom styleher worksbi default word buildsth tabl contentsfrom text formattedwith builtin head stylebut also tell wordto look stylesinclud one createin document let say want addbrief descript like thisund head entryto well use custom stylein section let select textsthat want appearin tabl contentsa see texti format normalwith rest paragraphopen style galleryand click creat stylewel call new style summaryw could click andmodifi formattingbut wont want lookjust like rest paragraphso click oknow text look samebut click onth paragraph seethat actual contain two stylesso need tell wordto includ new styleclick ahead tabl contentsthen open tabl content galleryand click custom tableof content optionsth first three head style matchedto first three toc levelsscrol new styleand map level 4 click okth preview show thenew style head 3click ok yesto replac current tableth summari text addedth thing left format itto look like summaryselect text tabl contentsopen style paneand scroll toc styleswhen ad text wemap toc level 4so mean formattedwith toc four styleclick arrow next totoc 4 click modifyclick format paragraphand indent left andright margin 15 inchesand click oklet also add italicsand click okmap custom style toc leve pretti quick easi way controlwhat appear tabl content
Modify a TOC with field codes,"So what exactly happenswhen you enter your optionsin the Table of Contents dialog box?To find out, let's go behind the scenes.Click the Table ofContents, and press Alt F9.At the heart of yourautomatic table of contentsis this, Field Codes.After you enter your options,Word creates field codes,which it then uses to buildyour table of contents.Field codes are nothing morethan a set of instructionscontaining a field name and switches.The field name, TOC, instructs Wordto build a table of contents,and the switches tell Wordhow you want it built.For example, this o switchtells Word to includeoutline styles one throughthree which are mappedto heading styles onethrough three, respectively.The h switch adds hyperlinks.And the t switch lists the otherstyles you want to include,which in this case is the Summary stylewe added in the last movie.Check out the course summaryfor a link to the full listof fields and switches.By the way, Word is full of field codesthat you may not even know about,such as this one for page numbers,but we won't go into all those here.After you generate fieldcodes with the dialog box,like table of contents,you can click in itand edit the code directly.This can be a lot faster sometimesthan dealing with dialog boxes.Also, you often havemore options availablewith the direct approach.I'll show you.Press Alt F9to show the table of contents again.Let's say we want toremove the page numbersfrom our descriptions.In the dialog box, we canremove all page numbersbut not from individual TOC levels.However, we can with field codes.Press Alt F9 again.Click just ahead of the t switch,and type the switch backslash n.Add a space.Then type four dash four, and a space.This switch tells Wordto suppress page numbersfor TOC level four.We need to type four dash fourbecause Word requires that thenumber be entered as a range.So page numbers will be suppressedfor levels four through four.Right-click the field code,and click Update Field,and Update Entire Table.Now press Alt F9,and you'll see thatthe page number is gonefrom the description.So TOC is the field name usedto create a table of contents,but for customizing what goesinto a table of contents,there's another fieldthat's just as useful, TC.",exactli happenswhen enter optionsin tabl content dialog boxto find let go behind scenesclick tabl ofcont press alt f9at heart yourautomat tabl contentsi field codesaft enter optionsword creat field codeswhich use buildyour tabl contentsfield code noth morethan set instructionscontain field name switchesth field name toc instruct wordto build tabl contentsand switch tell wordhow want builtfor exampl switchtel word includeoutlin style one throughthre mappedto head style onethrough three respectivelyth h switch add hyperlinksand switch list otherstyl want includewhich case summari stylew ad last moviecheck cours summaryfor link full listof field switchesbi way word full field codesthat may even know aboutsuch one page numbersbut wont go hereaft gener fieldcod dialog boxlik tabl contentsy click itand edit code directlythi lot faster sometimesthan deal dialog boxesalso often havemor option availablewith direct approachil show youpress alt f9to show tabl content againlet say want toremov page numbersfrom descriptionsin dialog box canremov page numbersbut individu toc levelshowev field codespress alt f9 againclick ahead switchand type switch backslash nadd spacethen type four dash four spacethi switch tell wordto suppress page numbersfor toc level fourw need type four dash fourbecaus word requir thenumb enter rangeso page number suppressedfor level four fourrightclick field codeand click updat fieldand updat entir tablenow press alt f9and youll see thatth page number gonefrom descriptionso toc field name usedto creat tabl contentsbut custom goesinto tabl contentsther anoth fieldthat use tc
Add custom entries to a TOC,"In the first movie,we used a custom styleto mark text to includein the table of contents.But by using the TC field,we have a lot more flexibility.We can create descriptivetext specificallyfor a table of contents andhide it in the field codeso that it appears inthe table of contents,but not the body of your document.Click at the beginningof the first paragraphin this section.Then click the Insert tab,click Quick Parts, and Field.With this dialog box, youcan insert any feel you want.Scroll down and click TC.When you do, you get these options,which correspond to the switchesthat are available for TC.Type the descriptive text youwant in the text entry box.This is the text that'llappear in the TOC,but not in the body of the document.Then under Field Options,check Outline Level, and type eight.This assigns TOC level eight to the text,so that it will be formattedwith the TOC eight style.You can use any TOC style you want.I choose eight, becauseit's not likely to be usedfor any other TOC entry.And finally, check Suppress Page Numbers,so the page number doesn't display.Click OK,and the field code is added.To see it, go to the Home tab,and click the Show/HideParagraph Marks button.Here's the field code.The text and the switchesthat the dialog box added.Click Show/Hide Paragraph Marks againto hide the field with the text.To finish, go back tothe table of contents,and press Alt F9to display the TOC field code.To instruct Word todisplay TC field entriesin the table of contents,click ahead of the t switch,and type backslash f.Add a space.That's it.Now update the field,and press Alt F9,and you can see the descriptionbelow Domestic Partners.The last thing we might wanto do is format the text.Go to the Home tab, andopen the Styles pane.Remember we assigned leveleight to the TC entry.So go to the TOC eight style,and click Modify.Click Format,and Paragraph,and indent the left and right margins,the same way we did in the summary style.Click OK,and click OK.Now you have another wayto add your own contentto a table of contents.Field codes may seem alittle scary at first,but they do open up awhole lot of possibilities.",first moview use custom styleto mark text includein tabl contentsbut use tc fieldw lot flexibilityw creat descriptivetext specificallyfor tabl content andhid field codeso appear inth tabl contentsbut bodi documentclick beginningof first paragraphin sectionthen click insert tabclick quick part fieldwith dialog box youcan insert feel wantscrol click tcwhen get optionswhich correspond switchesthat avail tctype descript text youwant text entri boxthi text thatllappear tocbut bodi documentthen field optionscheck outlin level type eightthi assign toc level eight textso formattedwith toc eight styley use toc style wanti choos eight becauseit like usedfor toc entryand final check suppress page numbersso page number doesnt displayclick okand field code addedto see go home taband click showhideparagraph mark buttonher field codeth text switchesthat dialog box addedclick showhid paragraph mark againto hide field textto finish go back toth tabl contentsand press alt f9to display toc field codeto instruct word todisplay tc field entriesin tabl contentsclick ahead switchand type backslash fadd spacethat itnow updat fieldand press alt f9and see descriptionbelow domest partnersth last thing might wanto format textgo home tab andopen style panerememb assign leveleight tc entryso go toc eight styleand click modifyclick formatand paragraphand indent left right marginsth way summari styleclick okand click oknow anoth wayto add contentto tabl contentsfield code may seem alittl scari firstbut open awhol lot possibl
Add multiple TOCs to a document,"In a verylarge complex documentit makes sense to provide readerswith multiple tables of contents,one for each section.And the way to do that is with,you guessed it, field codes.In Outline Viewyou can see that this sample document hasthree major sectionsfilled with subsections.To make it easier forthe readers to navigate,let's add a table of contentsto each major section.To do that we'll start by addingTC fields to each subsection heading.You'll see how it works as we go along.Click in front of the firstsubsection heading in the first section.Then go to the Insert tab,click Quick Parts, and Field.Then scroll down and click TC.Type the name of the subsection,then check TC entry indoc with multiple tables.This will add a switch to the code,the f switch that enables usto add multiple tables of contents.Then check Outline level and type 1.This'll format the entryin the table of contentswith the TOC one style.Click OK.Next, go to the Home taband show paragraph marksso we can see the field code.There's the f switch.It enables us to add multipletables of contents to a documentby assigning a typeidentifier to the entry.Click after the f.We can use any letter as the identifier,but let's just call this entry an x type.Type space and x.Next, we need to mark theother subsection headings.And we can do that by simply selectingthe field code and copying it.Delete the text inside the quotation marksand type the subsection name.After you finish one section,go to the next one.Change the text.And also, change the identifier.We'll identify this section as y.Go through all the subsection headingsand add the y type to the field code.When you get to the third section,change the f switch value to zand then add the fieldcode to the other headings.So, when you finish,all the subsectionsare labeled x, y, or z,depending on which section they're in.Now we'll add the table of contents.Click the line below thefirst section heading,then go to the References tab,click Table of Contents,and Custom Table of Contents.Click Options.Then uncheck Styles and Outline levelsand check Table entry fields.Now Word will include only textthat's marked with TC field codes.Click OK and OK.The TOC field code is added,but no table of contentsentries are found.Why is that?Press Alt and F9 to show the field code.The f switch was added to the code,but there's no type identifier.And if none is added,Word looks for the default type C.Type x after the f switch.Then right click the codeand update the field.Press Alt F9 to showthe table of contents.As planned, the table of contents showsonly the headings in this section,the ones with the type x entries.Next you can copy the TOC fieldcode to the other sections,change the f switch to y,and then z.As a final touch,we'll add a high level table of contentsat the beginning of the document.Click Table of Contents andCustom Table of Contents.Select only one level and click OK.And the table of contents showsonly Heading 1 style text.So now you know how tocustomize an automatictable of contents to showwhatever text you want.",verylarg complex documentit make sens provid readerswith multipl tabl

Mail merge,"Mail mergeis all about mass mailingsthat you individualize for each recipient.You can add individualelements to any part ofa label, letter, envelope, or emailfrom the greeting to theentire document, even images.You start with a main document.Attach a list of recipient informationand add mail merge fields.Then Word automaticallyfills in the fieldswith the recipientinformation and generatesall the individual documents.In this course we'll start with emailthen move on to letters and envelopes.Here's a quick way to get started.On the mailings tab,click Start Mail Mergeand Step-by-Step Mail Merge Wizard.Select the type of documentyou want to add mail merge toand click next.Here you can start a newdocument from a templateor existing document.Since our document is already open,we'll select Use the Current Document.A recipient list can comefrom one of three places:An existing list such as a mailing listyou created in Microsoft Excel,Microsoft Outlook contacts,or you can type a new list.Let's say we want to send an emailto customers in our Outlook contacts.When you select this option,you also need to choosewhich contacts folder to use.I've already created a folder in Outlookto hold my customer contacts,so we'll select that one and click OK,and Word adds the contactsto a recipient list.If you want, you cancheck through the listand edit it before you run the mail merge.For example, if you have a large listyou may want to send the email in chunks.You can click the arrow next to lastand sort the list in ascending order.Uncheck the box at the topto uncheck all the contactsthen start by sendingemail only to contactswith last names thatbegin with B, C, and D.When you're done, click OK.Next, we'll add the mail mergefields to the email message.Let's keep it simple and justadd a greeting line field.Delete the one we have there nowand click Greeting Line.First select a format.We'll keep Dear, but let'schange the name formatto something less formaland we'll keep the comma.If there's a problemwith the recipient name,Word inserts this generic greeting.Let's change it to DearCustomer with a comma.Down here you can clickthrough the contactsto preview the greeting line for each one.When you're done, click OK andWord inserts the merge field.Click Next and Word temporarilyreplaces the merge fieldswith entries from the recipient listso you can preview howeach email will lookbefore it's sent.This is particularly usefulif your email containsa lot of merge fields.If everything looks okay, clickNext to complete the merge.Click Electronic Mail,add a subject line for the emails,and click OK when you'reready to send them.So the wizard can help you getup to speed with mail mergebut once you know the process,you can often go fasterby entering the options directly.Up next, we'll do that when we print letters with mail merge.",mail mergei mass mailingsthat individu recipienty add individualel part ofa label letter envelop emailfrom greet theentir document even imagesy start main documentattach list recipi informationand add mail merg fieldsthen word automaticallyfil fieldswith recipientinform generatesal individu documentsin cours well start emailthen move letter envelopesher quick way get startedon mail tabclick start mail mergeand stepbystep mail merg wizardselect type documenty want add mail merg toand click nexther start newdocu templateor exist documentsinc document alreadi openwel select use current documenta recipi list comefrom one three placesan exist list mail listyou creat microsoft excelmicrosoft outlook contactsor type new listlet say want send emailto custom outlook contactswhen select optiony also need choosewhich contact folder useiv alreadi creat folder outlookto hold custom contactsso well select one click okand word add contactsto recipi listif want cancheck listand edit run mail mergefor exampl larg listyou may want send email chunksyou click arrow next lastand sort list ascend orderuncheck box topto uncheck contactsthen start sendingemail contactswith last name thatbegin b c dwhen your done click oknext well add mail mergefield email messagelet keep simpl justadd greet line fielddelet one nowand click greet linefirst select formatwel keep dear letschang name formatto someth less formaland well keep commaif there problemwith recipi nameword insert gener greetinglet chang dearcustom commadown clickthrough contactsto preview greet line onewhen your done click ok andword insert merg fieldclick next word temporarilyreplac merg fieldswith entri recipi listso preview howeach email lookbefor sentthi particularli usefulif email containsa lot merg fieldsif everyth look okay clicknext complet mergeclick electron mailadd subject line emailsand click ok yourereadi send themso wizard help getup speed mail mergebut know processy often go fasterbi enter option directlyup next well print letter mail merg
Print letters with mail merge,"So now that youhave the basics of mail mergelet's try some different options.First of all, you don'thave to use the wizardif you don't want to.Everything you need to do with mail mergeis right here on the Mailings tab.Click Start Mail Merge,and let's convert theemail messages to letters.In the document body,all we have to do isdelete the hyperlinks.Also, click Select Recipients,and let's type a new recipient listthat has mailing addresses.Click in any field,and start typing.Press Tab to move to the next column,or Shift Tab to move back.When you've finished addinginformation for one recipient,click New Entry to add the next one.Typing a list can be a lot of work,but keep in mind thatyou're creating a databasethat can be used again inother documents and

click Save.Now you can click EditRecipient List any timeto view and sort the list.Click the file name inData Source, and Editto add or delete entries,and edit the data.Simply click a field and type.To delete an entire recipient,click on the column tothe left of the entryand press Delete,and Yes.When you're finished, click OKand save your updated list.Finally, let's add an addressblock to top of the letter.Click ahead of the greeting line,press Enter a couple of times,and click the line at the top.Then click Address Block.You decide what to includein the address blockon the left side,and preview the addresses over here.First, let's choose aless formal name formatto match the greeting.Next, you can decide whetherto insert the company name.For this letter, companyname doesn't apply.Also, our customers are local,so we can choose to nevershow the country or region.This last option modifiesthe address formataccording to the country or region.Again, this option doesn't apply.When you're finished settingup the address block,click OK,and the address block fieldis added to the letter.Now if you want to see whatthe actual letters look likeinstead of the mail merge field code,click

Advanced mail merge (Field code),"If you use mailmerge a lot in your business,then this course is for you.Everything is okay withit except for one thing,the mileage field doesn't have a comma.It may seem like small thing,but to get that comma,we need to go beyond thebasic mail merge commands.When you turn off Preview Results,you see the mail merge fieldsthat generated the merged text.Now press Alt + F9,and you see the code thatgenerated the merge field,called field code.Field codes are place holders for datathat you want Word to add automatically.They're not just used for merge fields.Field codes are also usedfor things like page numbersand automatic tables of contents.By default, field codesare hidden from view,though with the keyboardshortcut ALT + F9,you can toggle betweenviewing the field codesand their results.In most cases you never haveto deal with field codesbecause Word adds them automaticallywhen you click commands,such as Insert MergeField and Greeting Line.So why do we ever haveto deal with field codes?Because there's someproperties you can't get towith Word commands alone.And one of them is mergefield number formatting,which will give us commas in numbers.The field code MERGEFIELD Mileageadds the mileage mergefield at that's all.If you want to use adifferent number formatting,you need to use something called a switch.And you do that by typing the switch codedirectly in the field code.Click after Mileage, press space,backslash, number sign, and space.Then in quotation marks,type three number signs,comma, and three more number signs.This is called a picture switch,a switch that provides a pictureof how you want Wordto format the numbers.The number signs inside the quotesare placeholders that Wordreplaces with numbers.Press ALT + F9 and press F9to update the field codeand preview the results.And there's the comma.Now press ALT + F9 and let's take a lookat that field code.Field codes are made up of a field name,properties, and optional switches.To learn more about aparticular field code,you can check the referencedocumentation link.The merge field of referenceshows you how to use the field code,lists the switches you can use with it,and provides examples.This webpage lists allthe field codes in Wordand provides links to thereferences for each one.As you probably figured out,field codes are not for everybody.To use them, you'll need tospend some time researchingand experimenting with coding techniques.But if you need to go beyondthe basic mail merge commands,then field codes are your ticket.",use mailmerg lot businessthen cours youeveryth okay withit except one thingth mileag field doesnt commait may seem like small thingbut get commaw need go beyond thebas mail merg commandswhen turn preview resultsy see mail merg fieldsthat gener merg textnow press alt f9and see code thatgener merg fieldcal field codefield code place holder datathat want word add automaticallytheyr use merg fieldsfield code also usedfor thing like page numbersand automat tabl contentsbi default field codesar hidden viewthough keyboardshortcut alt f9you toggl betweenview field codesand resultsin case never haveto deal field codesbecaus word add automaticallywhen click commandssuch insert mergefield greet lineso ever haveto deal field codesbecaus there someproperti cant get towith word command aloneand one mergefield number formattingwhich give us comma numbersth field code mergefield mileageadd mileag mergefield that allif want use adiffer number formattingy need use someth call switchand type switch codedirectli field codeclick mileag press spacebackslash number sign spacethen quotat markstyp three number signscomma three number signsthi call pictur switcha switch provid pictureof want wordto format numbersth number sign insid quotesar placehold wordreplac numberspress alt f9 press f9to updat field codeand preview resultsand there commanow press alt f9 let take lookat field codefield code made field nameproperti option switchesto learn aparticular field codey check referencedocument linkth merg field referenceshow use field codelist switch use itand provid examplesthi webpag list allth field code wordand provid link therefer onea probabl figur outfield code everybodyto use youll need tospend time researchingand experi code techniquesbut need go beyondth basic mail merg commandsthen field code ticket
Create and print labels,"Word makes it easy for youto create many different kinds of labels.Typically, labels come in sheetsthat you place in the tray of your printerjust like a stack of paper.After they're printed, you peel them off.You can find labelsthat work with almost any type of printerwhether it's an inkjet or a laser.You can even get continuous feed labels.When you find the label you want,let's say we're lookingfor simple address labels,check to see if there's atemplate for it in Word.Why?Because templates cansave you a lot of time.I'll show you what I mean.Let's create some return address labels.Open a blank document in Word.Click the Mailings tab and click Labels.Then click Options.Under Printer Information,choose the type of printer you have.The printer we're gonna useis a basic page printer.Next, choose a label vendor.As you can see, thereare a lot to choose from.We'll go with Avery US Letter.That gives us the standard US letter sizeof 8-1/2 by 11 inches.Then choose the product templateyou want from that vendor.Having a label template saves you timebecause all the setup is done for you.Click Details and you cansee all the measurementsthat we won't have to enternow because we have a template.If you need to use a labelthat doesn't have a template,see Movie Four to find out howto create a custom template.So once you have your labelsand you've selected theappropriate template,you can add your content.Click OK.In the box labeled Address,type your address or other content.Next, decide whether to printa full page of the same labelor just print a single label.Let's stick with full page.We'll do a single label in a moment.Finally, we can move rightahead and print the labelsor click New Document.When we do that, Word placesthe labels in a new documentthat's ready to print.The advantage of doing it this wayis that we can add formatting.We'll look into that in Movie Three.When you're ready to print,click File and Print.Check the Print Preview,make sure the right printer is selectedand the label sheetsare in the printer tray,and then click Print.Before we move on, clickMailings and Labelsand I'll show you how toprint one label at a timeinstead of a whole page.For example, you might wanna do thisif you only have onelabel left on a sheet.Let's say we wanna print thelabel on row three column two.Click Printand the full sheet of labelsgoes through the printerbut only that one label is printed on.So now you know how tocreate multiple labelswith the same text.Up next, we'll create multiplelabels with different textsthat we can use for mass mailing.",word make easi youto creat mani differ kind labelstyp label come sheetsthat place tray printerjust like stack paperaft theyr print peel offyou find labelsthat work almost type printerwheth inkjet lasery even get continu feed labelswhen find label wantlet say lookingfor simpl address labelscheck see there atempl wordwhybecaus templat cansav lot timeil show meanlet creat return address labelsopen blank document wordclick mail tab click labelsthen click optionsund printer informationchoos type printer haveth printer gon na usei basic page printernext choos label vendora see therear lot choos fromwel go averi us letterthat give us standard us letter sizeof 812 11 inchesthen choos product templatey want vendorhav label templat save timebecaus setup done youclick detail canse measurementsthat wont enternow templateif need use labelthat doesnt templatese movi four find howto creat custom templateso labelsand youv select theappropri templatey add contentclick okin box label addresstyp address contentnext decid whether printa full page labelor print singl labellet stick full pagewel singl label momentfin move rightahead print labelsor click new documentwhen word placesth label new documentthat readi printth advantag wayi add formattingwel look movi threewhen your readi printclick file printcheck print previewmak sure right printer selectedand label sheetsar printer trayand click printbefor move clickmail labelsand ill show toprint one label timeinstead whole pagefor exampl might wan na thisif onelabel left sheetlet say wan na print thelabel row three column twoclick printand full sheet labelsgo printerbut one label print onso know tocreat multipl labelswith textup next well creat multiplelabel differ textsthat use mass mail
Use mail merge to create multiple labels,"If you wanted to create a bunch of recipient address labels can you type them all manually in an empty label document like this? But there's a much better way and it's called mail merge I'll show you how it works.Click the mailings tab and click start mail merge.And labels.You start by selecting your label options will just use the same labels from the first movie and click OK.And word adds blank labels to a new document.To see the labels click the table tools layout tab and click view gridlines.Next we need to add addresses to the labels and will do that by creating a recipient list.Go back to the mailings tab click select recipients and type, a new list.Click a box under the header row and start typing.To save time you can press tab to move right.Or shift tab to move left.Feeling as much information as you want and click new entry to add the next recipient.You can have as many recipients as you want and change the list at anytime.When you're finished click OK.Enter a name for the list and save it.So now we have her blank labels and a list of names to add to them. The last thing we need to do is decide how we want the recipient addresses to look on the labels and the easiest way to do that is to add an address block.In this first section you choose how you want the name to appear. Let's select a less formal format.When you select an option over here, you can see a preview over here of how will look applied the names in your list.Click these arrows to move through the entries.Next you can decide whether you want to insert the company name.And went to include the country or region.This last option modifies the address format, according to the country or region. For example, Org formats, the Postal code differently for this address in France.When you're finished setting up the address block return the preview to the first entry and click OK.And the block is added to the first label to add it to all the labels click update labels.Now, if you want to see what the actual labels look like instead of the mail merge code click preview results.So now are labels are ready to print or are they actually many of the addresses are cut off, and we also want to add a small logo up next will fix all that by formatting the labels and adding a graphic.",want creat bunch recipi address label type manual empti label document like there much better way call mail merg ill show worksclick mail tab click start mail mergeand labelsy start select label option use label first movi click okand word add blank label new documentto see label click tabl tool layout tab click view gridlinesnext need add address label creat recipi listgo back mail tab click select recipi type new listclick box header row start typingto save time press tab move rightor shift tab move leftfeel much inform want click new entri add next recipienty mani recipi want chang list anytimewhen your finish click okent name list save itso blank label list name add last thing need decid want recipi address look label easiest way add address blockin first section choos want name appear let select less formal formatwhen select option see preview look appli name listclick arrow move entriesnext decid whether want insert compani nameand went includ countri regionthi last option modifi address format accord countri region exampl org format postal code differ address francewhen your finish set address block return preview first entri click okand block ad first label add label click updat labelsnow want see actual label look like instead mail merg code click preview resultsso label readi print actual mani address cut also want add small logo next fix format label ad graphic
Format and add a graphic,"After you initially set up your labels you can make changes and add finishing touches before you go to print if you want to change the names or addresses. You can edit the recipient list. Here you can decide which names you want to place on the labels without changing the list itself.If you want to change the actual content of the list click the data source and click edit.Then you can click an item and type.Or add a new entry.Now, what about the formatting if you want to modify the address block start by deleting the old one in the first label make sure you select the entire cell.Then click address block.Create a new address block then make sure the first entry is selected in the preview area and click OK.Then click update labels.If you want to modify the look at the label content. You can go to the home tab and use any of the text formatting tools. Let's change the line spacing so the last line isn't chopped off select all the text in the first cell.Click line in paragraph spacing an line spacing options.Let's try changing the line spacing at value 2.6.Click OK.That should leave plenty of room for an additional liner 2.Then go to the mailings tab and click update labels.You can also use any of the other font or paragraph options for example, you may want to add a color or change the font style.The only thing you don't want to do is change the alignment of the cell borders because then the text won't line up with the labels when you go to print.You also have formatting options you can use on the table tools tabs that's right in case you hadn't noticed word lays out the labels by using a table.Again, you don't want to change the cell size are margins.But you can click this icon to select the table.And then click this button to center, the text against the left margin.The last thing will do is add a small graphic in each label click ahead of the first line of text in the first cell.And go to the answer tab.Then click pictures.Choose a picture it's probably a good idea to use something fairly simple.Click this layout options, but next to the picture and Select Square.Now you can drag a corner handle to resize the picture.And then click the center of the picture and move it into place.Finally, when the layout of the first label looks the way you want it go to the mailings tab and update the labels one last time.Now you can click file.And print.Check print preview to see what the label sheet looks like without the gridlines, then load your label sheets in the printer and click print.So now you have the basics of creating in printing labels in word.",initi set label make chang add finish touch go print want chang name address edit recipi list decid name want place label without chang list itselfif want chang actual content list click data sourc click editthen click item typeor add new entrynow format want modifi address block start delet old one first label make sure select entir cellthen click address blockcreat new address block make sure first entri select preview area click okthen click updat labelsif want modifi look label content go home tab use text format tool let chang line space last line isnt chop select text first cellclick line paragraph space line space optionslet tri chang line space valu 26click okthat leav plenti room addit liner 2then go mail tab click updat labelsy also use font paragraph option exampl may want add color chang font styleth thing dont want chang align cell border text wont line label go printyou also format option use tabl tool tab that right case hadnt notic word lay label use tableagain dont want chang cell size marginsbut click icon select tableand click button center text left marginth last thing add small graphic label click ahead first line text first celland go answer tabthen click pictureschoos pictur probabl good idea use someth fairli simpleclick layout option next pictur select squarenow drag corner handl resiz pictureand click center pictur move placefin layout first label look way want go mail tab updat label one last timenow click fileand printcheck print preview see label sheet look like without gridlin load label sheet printer click printso basic creat print label word

Track changes in email with multiple people,"So, how do you handle changesfrom two or more people whenyou can't collaborate online?And what do you do if a reviewerdoesn't turn on Track Changes?Without being able to see what's changed,how do you merge theinput from one reviewer,much less two or more?Well, Word lets you combinethe documents in such a waythat you can see everyone's changesclearly marked in one place.Here's how it works.First, save the documentsto your computer.Then go to the Review tab,click Compare and Combine.Under Original document, click Browse.Click your original and Open.Then under Revised document, click Browse,and open the documentfrom the first reviewer.Make sure the reviewer's name shows here.By default, Word comparesjust about everything,but you can uncheck itemsthat you don't want Word to compare.Also by default, Word shows the changesin the original document,but you can change thatto show the changesin the revised documentor create a new document.Click OK.By default, Word uses the formattingfrom the original document,but if you want, youcan use the formattingthat your reviewer changed.Click Continue with Merge.And Word copies the changeditems from the revised documentinto the original andpresents them as markup,as if the reviewer had added the changeswith Track Changes turned on.Now if you need to include thechanges from more reviewers,you can continue to combinedocuments into the original.First, save the original,then click Compare, and Combine.Add the original over here.Then under Revised document,select the document from thesecond reviewer, and click OK.Now the changes andcomments from both reviewersare combined in one document using markup.By default, each reviewer's changes appearin a different color,but the automatic colors may be differenton the reviewers' computers.Also, when you hold themouse over a change,you can see who made the change and when.Make sure Track Changes is turned on,then go through the documentand decide what you wanna dowith the comments and changes,the same as you did in movie two.If you plan to send the document backto the reviewers for another go-around,you can reply to the comments if you want.Click this button and type the reply.If overlapping changesmake it too difficultto read, try this.Click Compare and Show Source Documents.You can show the original, therevised, or both documents.In the top window, you see the originalafter adding the first reviewer.And in the bottom window,you can see the second reviewer's changes.Scroll the document in the main window,and all the windows scroll in sync.If this doesn't make iteasier to read, try this.Click the arrow next to display for reviewand select No Markup.Sometimes getting themarkup out of the way helps.And you can always show the markup againby clicking All Markup.When you're finished,keep Track Changes on,then click File and Save Asif you wanna save differentversions of the document.For example, you couldname this one draft two.The reviewers can open the documentand add any changes andreply to your replies.When you get all the revisions back,follow the same process tocombine the revised documentswith your

Working with watermarks,"Watermarks are text or picturesthat appear in thebackground of a document,typically on every page.It's easy to add one in Word.On the design tab, click watermark,and select one from the gallery.You can use watermarksfor a number of things,such as identification orbranding, like a company logo,for security or legal purposes, or simply as a design or decorative element.Open the watermarkgallery, where you can useone of the pre-designed watermarks,or, if you want morecontrol over how it looks,you can create a custom watermark.Double click the box nextto text, and start typing.Change the font if youwant, and choose a size.If you want the text to automaticallyextend to the left andright margins, select auto.You can choose a color other than gray,but don't choose something that will bedistracting to the reader.You can click apply at anytime to see what it looks like.Select semi-transparent todim the text a bit more.And, finally, choosewhether to layout the text horizontallyor diagonally.Click OK or close if you'vealready applied the settings.Now, check through thedocument to make sureyou can see the watermark,and it doesn't compete with your text.To get a more accuratepicture of how the watermarkwill look when you print the document,click file, and click print.Then, check the print preview.Click the page selector to look throughthe print preview of the document.On this page, the chart hasa solid color backgroundthat covers the watermark.If it's important foryou to see the watermarkthrough a chart, you canmake the chart background semi-transparent.Go to the page that the chart is on.With the background shape selected,go to the chart tools format tab,click shape fill,and more fill colors.Then, change thetransparency to around 50.You can do this with shapesand other objects, too.Finally, if you want toremove the watermark,simply open the watermark gallery,and click remove watermark.If your document contains sections,your watermark might notshow up on every page.You'll learn more abouthow to deal with thatin movie three.Up next, you'll see howto add a logo or pictureas a watermark.",watermark text picturesthat appear thebackground documenttyp everi pageit easi add one wordon design tab click watermarkand select one galleryy use watermarksfor number thingssuch identif orbrand like compani logofor secur legal purpos simpli design decor elementopen watermarkgalleri useon predesign watermarksor want morecontrol looksyou creat custom watermarkdoubl click box nextto text start typingchang font youwant choos sizeif want text automaticallyextend left andright margin select autoy choos color graybut dont choos someth bedistract readery click appli anytim see look likeselect semitranspar todim text bit moreand final choosewheth layout text horizontallyor diagonallyclick ok close youvealreadi appli settingsnow check thedocu make surey see watermarkand doesnt compet textto get accuratepictur watermarkwil look print documentclick file click printthen check print previewclick page selector look throughth print preview documenton page chart hasa solid color backgroundthat cover watermarkif import foryou see watermarkthrough chart canmak chart background semitransparentgo page chart onwith background shape selectedgo chart tool format tabclick shape filland fill colorsthen chang thetranspar around 50you shapesand object toofin want toremov watermarksimpli open watermark galleryand click remov watermarkif document contain sectionsyour watermark might notshow everi pageyoul learn abouthow deal thatin movi threeup next youll see howto add logo picturea watermark
Add a logo or other picture,"It's useful to be ableto quickly add a text watermark,but being able to addpictures and other objectsopens up many more possibilities.Open the watermark gallery,and click Custom Watermark.Then click Picture watermarkand Select Picture.Choose a picture fileand click Insert.Click Apply.By default, Word centersa picture verticallyand scales or resizes it automaticallyto extend to the left and right margins.Also, the image is washedout or made semi-transparentso it doesn't compete visuallywith the foreground text.Click Scale if you want tochange how the image is scaled.For example, you canscale it to half the size,twice the size,keep it at its original size,or enter your own scale setting.Clear the Washout checkbox,and click Apply to see what that does.As you can see, mostwatermark pictures needto be washed out a bit so theydon't distract the reader.Click OK or Close.Watermark pictures aretricky because you haveto find an image thatis easily recognizablebut doesn't fight for dominancewith the foreground text.This logo works pretty wellbecause the reader willimmediately know what it isand it contains simpleshapes and only two colors.But we can make it even more unobtrusive.Open the watermark gallery,and click Custom Watermark.And let's choose this other logothat has a dusty blue color.Click Apply.As you can see,the hue and depth of the coloralso affects readability.You'll also want to avoid pictureswith lots of fine detailand images like thisthat take too much effortto figure out.Again, keep it simple.And before you make any final decisions,click File and Print,to get a more accurate impressionof how the document willlook when it's printed.So now you have the basicsof adding watermarks,but you can do a lot more with 'em.If you're ready, let'sdig a little deeper.To Word, a watermark is nothingmore than a header or footerthat's in a different place.I'll show you what I mean.Double-click the header of your documentto open the header and footer for editing.Now you can click thewatermark and select it.What is the significance of this?Well, it means that now youcan work with your watermark,just like any otherpicture or shape or object.For example, you can press Shiftand drag a corner handleto resize the imagewhile keeping its originalaspect ratio or shape.Then you can click the center of itand move it to a new location.And notice that the watermark changeson the other pages too.You also have all the tools onthe picture tools Format tab.For example, you canchange the brightness,recolor the picture,even add a border.Accessing watermarksthrough headers and footersopens up a whole newworld of possibilities.Up next, we'll takewatermarks to the next level.",use ableto quickli add text watermarkbut abl addpictur objectsopen mani possibilitiesopen watermark galleryand click custom watermarkthen click pictur watermarkand select picturechoos pictur fileand click insertclick applybi default word centersa pictur verticallyand scale resiz automaticallyto extend left right marginsalso imag washedout made semitransparentso doesnt compet visuallywith foreground textclick scale want tochang imag scaledfor exampl canscal half sizetwic sizekeep origin sizeor enter scale settingclear washout checkboxand click appli see doesa see mostwatermark pictur needto wash bit theydont distract readerclick ok closewatermark pictur aretricki haveto find imag thati easili recognizablebut doesnt fight dominancewith foreground textthi logo work pretti wellbecaus reader willimmedi know isand contain simpleshap two colorsbut make even unobtrusiveopen watermark galleryand click custom watermarkand let choos logothat dusti blue colorclick applya seeth hue depth coloralso affect readabilityyoul also want avoid pictureswith lot fine detailand imag like thisthat take much effortto figur outagain keep simpleand make final decisionsclick file printto get accur impressionof document willlook printedso basicsof ad watermarksbut lot emif your readi letsdig littl deeperto word watermark nothingmor header footerthat differ placeil show meandoubleclick header documentto open header footer editingnow click thewatermark select itwhat signific thiswel mean youcan work watermarkjust like otherpictur shape objectfor exampl press shiftand drag corner handleto resiz imagewhil keep originalaspect ratio shapethen click center itand move new locationand notic watermark changeson page tooyou also tool onth pictur tool format tabfor exampl canchang brightnessrecolor pictureeven add borderaccess watermarksthrough header footersopen whole newworld possibilitiesup next well takewatermark next level
More things you can do with pictures,"If you wantto have complete flexibilityto customize waternarked pictures,you can go to the next level andbypass the watermark gallery altogether.I'll show you how, double click the header to open headers and footers.Click insert and selectthe rectangle shape,then draw a rectangle on the page,because the header andfooter editor is open,we're actually drawing the rectanglein the header of the document,which places it in a layer behind the textand on all the pages of the document.To add a picture, go to thedrawing tools format tab,click shape fill and click picture.Select a picture and insert it.Now, why don't we add the pictureto the field property of the shape,instead of directly to the pagebecause this way, we have more optionsto work with including transparency.When you add a picture to a shape,it stretches to fill this shape.To get it back to itsoriginal aspect ratio,click the picture tools format tab,click, crop and click, fit.Then adjust the crop handles to remove the empty space around the picture.Click crop again to turn it off,then, go back to the drawing tools taband remove the shape outline.Now we can resize the picture,move it, or line it automatically by clicking the drawing tools format tab.Clicking align and clickingalign center and align middle.Next, click the formatshape dialog box launcherand the fill in linetab, now you can adjust the transparency so itdoesn't compete with the text.Click the picture tab,and you have settings forbrightness, contrast and color.Try the sharpness setting to blur a picture slightly if ithas a lot of detail.For this picture, let'sgo to the effects taband add an artistic effect.This is another tool you can use to reducethe detail of the picture to pushit more into the background.Again, when you wannasee what the watermarkwill look like when it'sprinted, click, file and print.Then check the pages.If you're happy with your watermark,you can reuse it in other documents.Click design and watermark, then click, save selection to watermark gallery.Type a name and click okay.Now, adding the watermark is as easy aslooking through the gallery.So now you have lots of optionsfor adding and working with watermarks.The secret, is accessingthrough the headerand footer editor, andhere's something elsebecause watermarks are relatedto headers and footers,you can also use the options on the headerand footer tools design tab.For example, click different first page, if you want a different watermark than the first page.You can also create sections to adddifferent watermarksthroughout a document.Here's the same documentwithout watermarks,I've zoomed back so youcan see three pages of it.I've also turned on show paragraph marks,so you can see that I'veadded a section here and here.Double click the header and you can seethe three sections that were created.Click next to go to the section two headerand turn off link to previous, then click, next to go to section three and turn off link to previous.By turning off the links, I've isolatedthe three sections, now I canclick the section one headerand insert a watermark, to keepit simple, I'll add a star shape.Then I can click the section two headerand add a different shape.And go to the third sectionand insert a third shape.Three different custom watermarkscreated by using sectionsthat were unlinkedand inserting the watermark graphicsdirectly to the header and footer.So now you know just about everythingthere is to know about watermarks.For related information, check outthe links in the

click Insert;Pivot table.All of the source data isautomatically selected;in this example,the entire source data table.We recommend using a tablebecause, if the table grows,the pivot table willautomatically include the new datawhen you refresh the pivot table.By default, the pivot table willbe created on a new worksheet.If you want, you can createit on an existing worksheet insteadby clicking Existing worksheet,and providing the location.Click OK.In our example, a new worksheetwith an empty pivot table was created.In the pivot table fieldslist, at the top,are the fields we'll useto create the pivot table.They're the same as thecolumn headings in the source data.At the bottom, are the four areas of a pivot table.The fields can be added to:rows, columns, values, and filters.I checked the genre field, and it's addedto the pivot table as rows of text labels.By default, text fields are addedas rows, and numbers as values.Check the Sales amount field,and it's added as a columnof values that are addedusing the SUM function.Right click a cell in theSum of sales amount column;click Number format;and click Currency.I don't want any digitsafter the decimal place.So I set the decimal places to zero;click OK, and we can see the totalsales for the different genres of books.I click and drag the Storefield to columns,and we can see the sales of genresfor each store, along with grand totals.An important factor we don't havein the pivot table yet are dates.How does sales differ over time?I check the Date field, andit's added to the rows area.But this many rows of dates,makes the pivot table hard to use.Let's group the list of dates:right click any date, and click Group.I'll use the default Months,but you can select one or more options,such as Quarters and Years; click OK.The dates are grouped under thegenres by month; much easier to work with.And we can see the sales of thegenres over time for each store.When you click any cell in a pivot table,the pivot table fields list,and the pivot table tools tab appear.When you click outside ofthe table, they go away.Under Pivot table tools,click the Design tab to change how the pivot table looks.For example, click Report layout,click Show an outline form,and now Genre and Date are in separate columns.Check banded rows, to make it easier to read across the rows of the pivot table.Click the down arrow next to Pivot table styles;there are many options.When you mouse over them,you get a preview of what the pivot table will look like.Click the style you want,to change the look of the pivot table.We will cover the Analysetab in subsequent videos.Up next: Sort, filter, summarize,and calculate your pivot table data.",tabl containsdata book salesit column thegenr booksth date soldth sale amountand store soldbefor creat pivot tableth data your go useref sourc datashould arrang correctlyal column headingsth head use nameth field pivot tableeach column containsth type datafor exampl text one columnand currenc anotherand beno blank row columnsfor pivot tablewel use sourc data that tableit doesnt tablea rang cell use wellclick cell data click insertpivot tableal sourc data isautomat selectedin exampleth entir sourc data tablew recommend use tablebecaus tabl growsth pivot tabl willautomat includ new datawhen refresh pivot tablebi default pivot tabl willb creat new worksheetif want createit exist worksheet insteadbi click exist worksheetand provid locationclick okin exampl new worksheetwith empti pivot tabl createdin pivot tabl fieldslist topar field well useto creat pivot tabletheyr thecolumn head sourc dataat bottom four area pivot tableth field ad torow column valu filtersi check genr field addedto pivot tabl row text labelsbi default text field addeda row number valuescheck sale amount fieldand ad columnof valu addedus sum functionright click cell thesum sale amount columnclick number formatand click currencyi dont want digitsaft decim placeso set decim place zeroclick ok see totalsal differ genr booksi click drag storefield columnsand see sale genresfor store along grand totalsan import factor dont havein pivot tabl yet dateshow sale differ timei check date field andit ad row areabut mani row datesmak pivot tabl hard uselet group list datesright click date click groupil use default monthsbut select one optionssuch quarter year click okth date group thegenr month much easier work withand see sale thegenr time storewhen click cell pivot tableth pivot tabl field listand pivot tabl tool tab appearwhen click outsid ofth tabl go awayund pivot tabl toolsclick design tab chang pivot tabl looksfor exampl click report layoutclick show outlin formand genr date separ columnscheck band row make easier read across row pivot tableclick arrow next pivot tabl stylesther mani optionswhen mous themyou get preview pivot tabl look likeclick style wantto chang look pivot tablew cover analysetab subsequ videosup next sort filter summarizeand calcul pivot tabl data

Adding a Column to a List or Library,"In this example, I'm goingto use a contact list to showhow to add columns, but the processis identical in document libraries.In this contact list I seecertain information,that I would like to track,but I don't see any column for the date when the item was created,maybe I should add a column to this list.Before creating a column,I must check whether the listalready contains some that Ican use, because the currentdisplay does notshow all the details.To see the columns that arealready in the list but are not visible in the display I am using,I click on the plus sign,and then on show hide columns,I can then choose todisplay or hide the existing columns, by checkingor unchecking this box.I can also change the orderin which the columns are displayedby clicking anddragging them or using the upand down buttons beside each column.Here is the created column I need, I will then add it to the display withoutcreating a new column.In this case, I madesure that I did not create a duplicate column in the list.If you really need tocreate a column, the quickest wayto do so, is byclicking on the plus sign.You can then choose amongseveral types of columns,but if you want a differenttype of column, click on plus.You can now see the different typesof columns, begin by choosing a type.In my case, I'm going tochoose the type called Choice.Choice, several new fields appear below, I will name this column frequency.I type a description, andthen, at the very bottom, I will put the options thatwill be displayed when a personadds an item to the list.Other settings are suggested,but because I want to keepthe default values, I click on OK.Here is the new column in the list.When someone adds a new item,a drop-down list will bedisplayed in the new column,  allowing them to chooseamong the options proposed.Lastly you can rename acolumn at any time, by clickingon the arrow beside itsname, then on column settings,and finally on the rename command.",exampl im goingto use contact list showhow add column processi ident document librariesin contact list seecertain informationthat would like trackbut dont see column date item createdmayb add column listbefor creat columni must check whether listalreadi contain ican use currentdisplay notshow detailsto see column arealreadi list visibl display usingi click plu signand show hide columnsi choos todisplay hide exist column checkingor uncheck boxi also chang orderin column displayedbi click anddrag use upand button besid columnher creat column need add display withoutcr new columnin case madesur creat duplic column listif realli need tocreat column quickest wayto byclick plu signyou choos amongsever type columnsbut want differenttyp column click plusyou see differ typesof column begin choos typein case im go tochoos type call choicechoic sever new field appear name column frequencyi type descript andthen bottom put option thatwil display personadd item listoth set suggestedbut want keepth default valu click okher new column listwhen someon add new itema dropdown list bedisplay new column allow chooseamong option proposedlastli renam acolumn time clickingon arrow besid itsnam column settingsand final renam command
Sorting and Filtering Items,"The more you use a list,the more it will be developed.You will then be able toobtain several pages of information.In this case, how can youfind what you were looking forand how can you display theinformation in a consistent manner.In this example,I am going to use a document library,but the process is identical for lists.If you want to find a specificitem, you can search for it here.Another way you can searchfor items is by using columnheadings to sort and filter the list.This list has been sorted inalphabetical order by name,but you can change this wayof sorting by clicking on the arrow beside the name of the column.And then choose a different option.You can also sort items by a different columnsuch as the name of theperson who created the item.Let's say that I rememberthe name of the person whocreated the document, but I am not sure about the name of the document.To make my search easier, Ican decide to display onlythe documents created bythis person by filtering the column with his or her name.To erase a filter, all you need to do is set your pointer on the column heading. Click on the arrow and erase the filter.These actions of sorting andfiltering lists are not permanent ones.In other words, if I leavethe page and I go back to it later on,I have to repeat these actions.However, if I want to save the list that has been sorted and filtered,I can save it as a display.Watch the video on this subjectto find out more about displays.Lastly, for more flexibility,when you are handling filters,you can use the filter window panethat includes all the current filters.",use listth developedy abl toobtain sever page informationin case youfind look forand display theinform consist mannerin examplei go use document librarybut process ident listsif want find specificitem search hereanoth way searchfor item use columnhead sort filter listthi list sort inalphabet order namebut chang wayof sort click arrow besid name columnand choos differ optiony also sort item differ columnsuch name theperson creat itemlet say rememberth name person whocreat document sure name documentto make search easier ican decid display onlyth document creat bythi person filter column nameto eras filter need set pointer column head click arrow eras filterthes action sort andfilt list perman onesin word leaveth page go back later oni repeat actionshowev want save list sort filteredi save displaywatch video subjectto find displayslastli flexibilitywhen handl filtersy use filter window panethat includ current filter
Creating and Managing Displays,"When the list gets longer,you may want to create your own displays, so thatyou can find items quickly.You may want to delete fields, thatyou don't want to use all the time.In this example, I'm goingto use a contact list to showhow to create displays, but theprocess is identical for document libraries.To create a personal display, you canuse one of the following two methods.The first method consists in doingthe sorting and filtering that you need,and adding or deleting columns,and then saving the display by clicking on:View options and choosing Save view.A window will be displayed.I'm going to give a name tomy display, and then chooseeither to make it public,so that anyone can see itor private; in which case Iwill keep it strictly for personal use,and then I will save it.My saved display will nowappear in View options,and I now have a new way ofsearching for information,as soon as I access this location.The second method consistsin starting from an existing display,I click on View options,and then on Edit current view.On the Edit view page,I will enter the names of the columns to be includedand do a search for them.I will delete the Personal phone column,because I don't need it anymore,and then I will add the function column.Next I will use positionnumbers, so that the Functioncolumn appears as column number 5,just after the Company name column.Now when I scroll downthe list, the sorting suits me,but I add a filter for Company name: is equal to Wide World Importers, because this is the company I am most often in contact with.Other options are available here,but I don't need them for the time being.Here is my new display,I can click to toggle from one display to another.As you have just seen, displays are veryuseful to organize information efficiently.",list get longery may want creat display thatyou find item quicklyy may want delet field thatyou dont want use timein exampl im goingto use contact list showhow creat display theprocess ident document librariesto creat person display canus one follow two methodsth first method consist doingth sort filter needand ad delet columnsand save display click onview option choos save viewa window displayedim go give name tomi display chooseeith make publicso anyon see itor privat case iwil keep strictli person useand save itmi save display nowappear view optionsand new way ofsearch informationa soon access locationth second method consistsin start exist displayi click view optionsand edit current viewon edit view pagei enter name column includedand search themi delet person phone columnbecaus dont need anymoreand add function columnnext use positionnumb functioncolumn appear column number 5just compani name columnnow scroll downth list sort suit mebut add filter compani name equal wide world import compani often contact withoth option avail herebut dont need time beingher new displayi click toggl one display anothera seen display veryus organ inform effici
Defining Alerts,"In your SharePoint's site,there is a very practicalfunction that allows you todefine alerts for listsand document libraries,so that you're kept up to dateabout any edits made in them.You can also create alerts for a single item,in a list or a document in a library.In this example,I'm going to use a list to create alerts,but the process isidentical for document libraries.To create an alert for a list,click on the ellipsis in the top menu,and then choose the Alert me option,an option window will openwhere you can refine your alert.First, create a title for the alert.By default SharePoint will use the list name,but you can change this if needed.My name is already on thelist of users who will receive this alert;I can add the names ofother members of my team,by typing their names in the user field,so that they also receive the alert.I can choose to bealerted by email or by SMS.I can then choose the type of edits,for which I would like to receive alerts.Lastly, I choose the alert frequency,in this example,I wanted to be alerted daily.I choose the time, when Iwant to receive an emailcontaining the edits that were made.create alerts for a list or a library,and not just the peoplewho created the list or the library.Once I click on OK, I willreceive a summary in my inbox.Lastly, I can click on Manage my alerts,at any time to see my list of alerts,in order to add, edit or delete an alert.",sharepoint sitether practicalfunct allow todefin alert listsand document librariesso your kept dateabout edit made themyou also creat alert singl itemin list document libraryin exampleim go use list creat alertsbut process isident document librariesto creat alert listclick ellipsi top menuand choos alert optionan option window openwher refin alertfirst creat titl alertbi default sharepoint use list namebut chang neededmi name alreadi thelist user receiv alerti add name ofoth member teambi type name user fieldso also receiv alerti choos bealert email smsi choos type editsfor would like receiv alertslastli choos alert frequencyin examplei want alert dailyi choos time iwant receiv emailcontain edit madecr alert list libraryand peoplewho creat list libraryonc click ok willrec summari inboxlastli click manag alertsat time see list alertsin order add edit delet alert

Getting started with the interface,"Hey Julian, you know what?No, what's going on?Can you imagine, managementhas decided that everyone hasto migrate to Windows 10 tonight.Since then, I dare not open my PC.Imagine that all is lost.How do I now manageto find my way around?Don't panic. You're inevitablygoing to find your way there.The new system adoptsfeatures in Windows 7 and Windows 8with some very practical innovations.Let's look at how toget you back on track.Your start menu isstill in the same place.With Windows 10, youadditionally have the possibility toconfigure it in order to quickly accessthe applications that you use frequently. Look at how to use it.The left side of the startmenu allows you to manageapplications, provide you with the suggestion of the most used applications, allow you to access settings and shut down or standby options.You also have access to thecomplete list of the programsinstalled on yourcomputer in alphabetical order.If you want quick access toone of them, simply slide itto the right menu to createa shortcut in the form of a tile and it will allow you tolaunch the application directly.In this way, you canorganize the right side as you wishby creating blocks ofresizable applications by right clicking or even accessingother options like Pin to task bar and if you want thestart menu to either be bigger or smaller, you can easily resize it.Not bad. But how do Iconfigure and customize?I was familiar with thecontrol panel, seems like it will be complicated here. One has to browse through menus.Lost.Actually most of thesettings is done via new settings application, in which you'll find all what you need in order to customize andconfigure your computer.They also thought of makinga dashboard where you willsimultaneously receive your alerts and manage the main functions and practices.This little icon allows you to open your Action Center. This feature allows you to receive alerts when you receive a new message for example.It also allows you to accessdifferent quick actions likeentering the tablet mode, access notes or project your screen. So still scared of Windows 10?No, of course not. I've understood that I'll find my way around.I like the idea of the mixbetween Windows 7 and Windows 8.With Windows 10, you cancustomize your environment in a very simple and fast way.The start menu givesyou quick access to your applications and the ActionCenter notifies you during new alerts and also allows you to access most of the settings and systems parameter.So thanks Windows 10.",hey julian know whatno what go oncan imagin managementha decid everyon hasto migrat window 10 tonightsinc dare open pcimagin losthow manageto find way arounddont panic your inevitablygo find way thereth new system adoptsfeatur window 7 window 8with practic innovationslet look toget back trackyour start menu isstil placewith window 10 youaddit possibl toconfigur order quickli accessth applic use frequent look use itth left side startmenu allow manageappl provid suggest use applic allow access set shut standbi optionsy also access thecomplet list programsinstal yourcomput alphabet orderif want quick access toon simpli slide itto right menu createa shortcut form tile allow tolaunch applic directlyin way canorgan right side wishbi creat block ofresiz applic right click even accessingoth option like pin task bar want thestart menu either bigger smaller easili resiz itnot bad iconfigur customizei familiar thecontrol panel seem like complic one brows menuslostactu theset done via new set applic youll find need order custom andconfigur computerthey also thought makinga dashboard willsimultan receiv alert manag main function practicesthi littl icon allow open action center featur allow receiv alert receiv new messag exampleit also allow accessdiffer quick action likeent tablet mode access note project screen still scare window 10no cours ive understood ill find way aroundi like idea mixbetween window 7 window 8with window 10 cancustom environ simpl fast wayth start menu givesy quick access applic actioncent notifi new alert also allow access set system parameterso thank window 10
I master multitasking,"Julian, I'm short of what to do.Since I started working onseveral projects at the same time,I'm obliged to openmultiple documents, multiple applicationsand I have so manyopen windows that I lose my windows.My apps disappearwhenever I switch to another.Uh, what a pain!Stop stressing for nothing.With Windows 10, it'svery easy to stay organized.Let me show you how.A tool was designed to help younot get lost and thus save time.The Task View featureallows for the creation ofdifferent virtualdesktops to sort programs.A new icon has appeared inthe task bar that allows youto view all open apps in your computerand you even get the chanceto create a new desktopto differentiate the different running tasks.The new desktop providesan additional work spaceand then allows the organization of the appsaccording to the projects towhich they are associated.Simply slip the applicationsin your new desktopand then you'll be able todistinguish between the two.You can then navigate from oneproject to another without getting mixed up.You can also pin up tofour applications at the fourcorners of the screen inorder to have a clearer space.For this, simply slip an application orwindow towards the edge of the screen.It then automatically positions itself.Also use the Windows keyplus the arrow to quickly movethem from one location to another.Look, my Excel files on theright and on the left I putmy Skype to share my datawith Marie who works in New York.Simple and convenient.I'd even say more,it is very convenient.I'll finally be able todifferentiate betweenmy applications based on my projectsand run several applications simultaneously.Were you able to save time and succeedto better organize yourself in your work?Yes, it's much better this way.I'm not lost anymore.Thanks to the Task Viewfeature, you can easily switchfrom one task to the otherand associate your programs todifferent virtual desktops,allowing you to betterorganize and manageall of your projects.",julian im short dosinc start work onsever project timeim oblig openmultipl document multipl applicationsand manyopen window lose windowsmi app disappearwhenev switch anotheruh painstop stress nothingwith window 10 itsveri easi stay organizedlet show howa tool design help younot get lost thu save timeth task view featureallow creation ofdiffer virtualdesktop sort programsa new icon appear inth task bar allow youto view open app computerand even get chanceto creat new desktopto differenti differ run tasksth new desktop providesan addit work spaceand allow organ appsaccord project towhich associatedsimpli slip applicationsin new desktopand youll abl todistinguish twoyou navig oneproject anoth without get mix upyou also pin tofour applic fourcorn screen inord clearer spacefor simpli slip applic orwindow toward edg screenit automat posit itselfalso use window keyplu arrow quickli movethem one locat anotherlook excel file theright left putmi skype share datawith mari work new yorksimpl convenientid even say moreit convenientil final abl todifferenti betweenmi applic base projectsand run sever applic simultaneouslywer abl save time succeedto better organ worky much better wayim lost anymorethank task viewfeatur easili switchfrom one task otherand associ program todiffer virtual desktopsallow betterorgan manageal project

Teams - Is it a lever to make collaborative work easier,"Today we will talk about Teams: Is it a lever to make collaborative work easier? First we will see: What is Teams? So, the big question everyone thinks about.Next we will see ""Different Teams for Different Uses"". How can we use it? Is it really useful or not? Next the interface of Teams, the logic behind it.During the session, we will see a couple of extras. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to use the chat. I will read it and answer. We have the objectives of this session:Identify how Teams works and how you can promote it.And introduce yourself to Teams and the environment of Teams. This session will be about 30 minutes, so let's go.First, what is Teams? To tell you about it, I will go through the history of Teams.First is the Office 365 portal. I'm on it because it's where we find Teams in the center of your screen. If it's not there, you can find it in the top left corner in the app launcher in All apps.Teams is linked in history with the Office 365 Groups. What is Groups? I will go on Outlook to tell you.It's a Teams session but we will go in Outlook to see it. Don't worry, we will go in Teams afterwards.This is Outlook like everyone knows. On the left we have Groups. We can find them in Outlook and it was one of the first things that allowed teamwork on the Office 365 portal.With these Groups we can have conversations. It's not really instant conversation, it's more like an email conversation, but with all of the Groups for example, I will go on a group here.We have old conversations from last year and recent conversations. Everyone can talk with all the members and they will have everything. I am telling this because with those Groups we have conversations,a file tab, a calendar tab or a notebook, a lot of things. We can find the same things on Teams. But what is the difference between those two? Groups was the first of the two.It is the ancestor of Teams if I could say. We can find the functionality of Groups in Teams but with new features, a better interface. It may be a bit more logic to navigate through Teams than to navigate through Groups.But if you use Groups you will have no problem to use Teams since it's the same logic.So now I will go on Teams to show you what it's about.What’s the logic behind Teams? On the left, we have everything we can do on Teams, activity chat, Teams, Meetings, etc. We will see through this during this session. First and the most important thing is the Teams tab.It is the core of Teams since we can create teams.What can teams be used for? A team can be used for as many things as you want,  for example for a project. I create a team just for it.In this project you can have different channels which are to divide a project in something. For example, if you have a part about realization, about the analysis, you can split your team into different channels.You can add teams directly and easily just by clicking on the button, create a team from scratch or join a team. I talked about Groups earlier, if you already have groups that you created,you can create a team from a group since it is the same logic behind it.So, you won't lose everything,you won’t have to a cut all your files or invite members in the new team, you can do it directly from a group.We can have different teams with different channels. When you create a channel, you have a general channel first, but you can create as much as you want.The logic in Teams is just the 3 dots to access more options, Add channel, Manage team. I will let you discover it by yourself.Once you have created a channel, you can add different tabs to your team for your projects or to manage a team, etc.The conversation tab is to interact with everyone. It's is a lot like a group tab: You can send messages, it's not it's instantaneous but even if someone doesn't answer immediately,they can answer in 2 weeks, there is no problem and there is a version history, remove people from Teams, etc. You can go through conversations, late January, without any problem.A File tab: You can link every file directly there.You can link those files with a channel specifically You can have as many tabs as you want in each channel. If you don't have any use for the Files tab in the realization channel, don't use it.If you need it in the analysis channel, maybe you should consider to use it.So, you can have tabs, you can add as many tabs as you want, tabs for the Office 365 application Excel forms OneNote or even for applications that are not Microsoft.YouTube, PowerApps, etc. You can use them directly in Teams and you will just have to click on a tab to go to it.You can centralize a lot of of information directly in a team, add as many tabs as you want.The tab  you create directly with the Office, 365 applications like Planner or OneNote will be specific to a team. For example, if you add a Planner, you will directly have a Planner created for you team.You won’t have to go to Planner to create it, modify it or add it to Teams.Its link is synchronized so you won't have to go from a software to another one and switch between them all the time. Teams is synchronized with most of the applications of Office 365.It may be the best point about Teams, it centralizes information. You won't have to go to Planner, OneNote or SharePoint, just go to Teams and you will find everything you want directly in the Files tab,the Planner tab or the SharePoint tab. You will have everything you need in one place and it may be the point you should consider when you are using Teams.We can do a lot of different things with Teams: You can link directly a tab with connectors for example, you can link a tab with Forms, Twitter, Yammer, you can link a channel with anything you want.An interesting fact with Teams is that it's not just limited to Office 365 applications but even in the connectors or in the Files tab. I can obviously take files from OneDrive, SharePoint since it’s a Microsoft application.But I can also add other cloud storage. If I need, for example, Dropbox files, I can directly link Teams with Dropbox or even with Google Drive. So if you are usually using Dropbox,you won't have to transfer all your files in SharePoint. You can just link there.It works with a lot of applications without having to do a lot of things. You just have to link it, no need to transfer or change all your files.You can create tabs in a channel to access directly and quickly different applications. You can connect to Channel with Yammer, Twitter and you can even add different storage spaces directly in Teams.So that's it for the uses you can make of teams and channels. You also have a lot of different things. Teams centralizes a lot of possibility. You can directly go to SharePoint to Planner.And have a conversation with your coworkers, but you can also go to a chat. You have a chat like you could have on Skype. If you don't really like using Skype you can use Teams, call people, add people and have conversations with different people.An interesting fact is that you also have access to tabs directly in a chat conversation. You are interacting with 2 people; you don't have to create a team if you just want to share 3 files. Obviously, you can send it as an attachment with Outlook,but you can also go in Teams and you have your Files tab. You can find everything you want even if the file was uploaded on this tab a year ago.It centralizes some functionalities you can find somewhere else like on Skype for example. You can also create meetings directly in Teams.I think everyone is used to go in Outlook to create a meeting, invite people. There you can schedule directly your meeting in Teams with the same possibilities you have in Outlook.Add titles, locations… It’s almost the same as Skype. In the location, you can have online, like in a team meeting, and select a channel to meeting.For example, I want to pick a channel in my project, the Analysis, so I will do a meeting in this channel. Everyone who has access to it can join the meeting. You can also invite people if you wish.For the other things: The start, the end, I won’t bother you with it.You can find a lot of functionalities that allow you to collaborate through other software: Share files with SharePoint or OneDrive, have a OneNote just for the team.For example, you were used to send your notebook if you needed to share something to someone. Now you don't have to, you can create a notebook in a tab and it will ask you if you want to create one to browse your notes or paste a link.You can create everything you need from scratch directly in Teams instead of going to all the applications. It's also way easier to navigate in just one software.Maybe at the start it will be a bit difficult to navigate in Teams. But for a basic user it's easier to navigate in one software that is Teams than to learn to navigate in SharePoint, Outlook, Skype, OneDrive or Planner.You have one place that centralizes everything you need.Also, you have other tabs. A Files tab so you can directly see your recent documents, “Book” in this OneDrive, in this tab “Communication”, etc.You can directly find what you need directly in these files. And an Activity file to see the feed or the activity of my team. My activity to have to be sure to see what we want to see.On the top right corner, you have different settings so you can set up things as you want:The notification settings. Do you want to receive an email if someone changes something in a team? I will go to see it rapidly.If the team role changes, if someone is invited in your team, do you want an email? Just a banner? Just in the feed? It’s as you wish; you can customize it as you want. Today I was presenting Teams via the online application, but you can also use the desktop application if you need.There is not that much difference but for example, in the Chat part, I can call someone, exchange emails but in the online application I can't do a video to share my face.So, what is Teams? It's a tool that centralizes everything you need about collaborative work and it's pretty easy to navigate. Just create a team with different channels: A team for a project, the steps of your project, so you can split everything as you need.Maybe for a big project you have a lot of people but not everyone is interested by the realization part, so they just won’t to have to go to the realization part. They could see what's in it, so they are not totally lost when you tell them:“Go to this and see what we can do.” To help them, you have different channels.I think that's all I had to say. I will just check the PowerPoint . We saw what is Teams, we went through a bit of history,Teams, Groups. Just to remind you, in Groups you had all the options that you have in Teams, even less. For example, you couldn't directly organize meetings or chat with audio calls with Groups but you can do it with Teams.Teams allows you to limit the number of applications you need to do a specific thing. You just need one application butif you need other options for a file, you can open in SharePoint, but you won't have to go to SharePoint for the basic things, like edit it, move it, copy it, download it. For example, if you want their version history, you need to go on SharePoint but for the basics you can stay on Teams and it will be enough.Like in Planner, you can have most of the functionalities. But if you really need to see a different plan that you created, go on Planner instead of just checking all your teams to see if things you are interested in are there.Teams can be used for different things, for a project, with your coworkers so you can share information when you have to. We saw the interface with on the left the different functionalities.In the middle left, our teams and our working space on the right. It's the same logic everywhere. And if you need right click you will still have most of the options: Favorites, Mute, Disable tips and tricks, Hide, etc.The couple of extras, I won’t list them all, but we saw some extras in this session.I won’t repeat myself again about what is Teams and the centralization part of this, but do you have any questions? You can use the chat at the top of Join.me if you need to ask me any questions.You want to know if we can have a specific user for a channel.You can add people in a team but for the channel you can't really invite people to one channel and not the team. If someone is in the channel, they’re obviously in the team so they can have access to all.So yes, the same people in teams and in the channel; So if you have some confidential things that you don't want people to see, Teams may not be the best tool since it's really collaborative.You have one team for one project for example, everyone can have access to the things in the channel. But if you need confidential work, you can create other teams or maybe use other applications to send something by email.Any other question?About external people.It can be accessed by external people, but it depends on the authorization, the security part of Teams,how the administrator makes it. If you don't want to be external people to access it, it won't be possible, but it's possible by default.Any other questions?If you don't have any questions, I will just ask you to go to your MOOC with the learning paths, the courses, tutorials, etc. And go to My account to evaluate the session.If you liked it or not, what was good, what was bad. I just ask you to answer honestly. First we can know that you were there and it can be important for us to improve our session in the future.Thank you for your participation in this session.Have a nice day.

What’s new in Windows 10,"Windows 10 is not just a blend ofWindows 7 and Windows 8.Many new features have seen theday with this new operating system.Here are some of them: Let’s start with the ‘Start menu’, which has been completely redesigned.It has quick links to your applications, your parameters, the ‘Power’ button and an area where you can pin your favourites.The Microsoft Store is a single location on all your devices where you will find new games, applications, music, films and series.The search box shown here on the taskbar displays results from your applications, your parameters, the Store, your files and the Web.The ‘Action center’ centralisesquick commands such as Wi-Fi,Bluetooth, airplane mode and other parameters you use the most.There, you will also find recent notification messages from your system and your applications.Cortana, an intelligent assistant,can help you in many ways.You can make requests in writingor orally to define reminders, look for information or simply discuss things.Work differently and use virtualdesktops to organize your open applications.Make communication easier by pinningyour favourite contacts on the taskbar.Security is strengthened under Windows 10.Welcome to Windows Hello, thebiometric authentication system.You can use facial, iris orfingerprint recognition to get connected.Here is a quick look at what you will discover in this course.",window 10 blend ofwindow 7 window 8mani new featur seen theday new oper systemher let start start menu complet redesignedit quick link applic paramet power button area pin favouritesth microsoft store singl locat devic find new game applic music film seriesth search box shown taskbar display result applic paramet store file webth action center centralisesquick command wifibluetooth airplan mode paramet use mostther also find recent notif messag system applicationscortana intellig assistantcan help mani waysyou make request writingor oral defin remind look inform simpli discuss thingswork differ use virtualdesktop organ open applicationsmak commun easier pinningyour favourit contact taskbarsecur strengthen window 10welcom window hello thebiometr authent systemy use facial iri orfingerprint recognit get connectedher quick look discov cours
Windows session and sign-in option,"When you start up your computer,the sign-in screen is displayedand, depending on the way Windows10 was setup when it was installed,you can connect either with a localaccount or a Microsoft account.What is a Microsoft account?It is simply your email address used in one of the Microsoft servicessuch as Outlook, Hotmail, Office 365, Skype and Xbox.Microsoft strongly suggests thatyou use this type of account because some Windows 10 features, such asOneDrive, need to access Microsoft Cloud.This is also useful if you want to synchronise your Windows and then automatically apply the changesmade to your other devices using Windows 10.Thus, if you want to take advantage of these features, you need to connect to Windows using a Microsoft account.If you do not have a Microsoft account, you can easily create a free email account on Outlook.com and use it as your new Microsoft account.Let’s go back to the login screen.Besides your username and its associated password, Windows 10 gives you several other options to identify yourself.You can use an image password, a confidential code or a PIN, or facial, iris or fingerprint recognition.your computer must be equipped for this type of authentication.If you have already configured oneof these sign-in modes, click on Sign-in options on the screen to use them.",start computerth signin screen displayedand depend way windows10 setup installedy connect either localaccount microsoft accountwhat microsoft accountit simpli email address use one microsoft servicessuch outlook hotmail offic 365 skype xboxmicrosoft strongli suggest thatyou use type account window 10 featur asonedr need access microsoft cloudthi also use want synchronis window automat appli changesmad devic use window 10thu want take advantag featur need connect window use microsoft accountif microsoft account easili creat free email account outlookcom use new microsoft accountlet go back login screenbesid usernam associ password window 10 give sever option identifi yourselfy use imag password confidenti code pin facial iri fingerprint recognitionyour comput must equip type authenticationif alreadi configur oneof signin mode click signin option screen use

Useful keyboard shortcuts,"To boost your productivity and save you time, your Windows system supports many keyboard shortcuts.You probably know a few from previous Windows versions, such as Ctrl + C, Ctrl + X and Ctrl + V that are used to copy, cut and paste items.In this video, we will look at the main new and old keyboard shortcuts.The first one is the Windows key that allows you to open and close the Start menu.If you combine the Windows key with the letter E, File Explorer will open.The Windows + I keys open Windows Settings and the Windows + A keysopen the Action center.The Windows + R combination allowsyou to open the Run dialog box,which is very useful to launchapplications, for example.You can also use the Windows + Spacebar keys to toggle between writing languages.Finally, the Windows + L combinationwill allow you to lock your computer.Let’s now look at how to manage open applications and windows.To toggle between windows, you can now use the Alt key, and then the Tab key to choose the window you want to display.Similarly, the Windows and Tab keys make it possible to display all your open applications and desktops.And to close an active window, use the Alt + F4 combination.You can also put windows side byside quickly by using the Windows + left or right arrow combinationto anchor a window on one side andthen choose the window that youwish to anchor on the other side.You can then take a screenshot byusing the Windows + Print Screen keys.The screenshot will be automaticallysaved in the Pictures folder.To see it, use the Windows + D combination to minimize all windows and display the desktop.The last two keyboard shortcutsthat we will look at make it possible to interact with Cortana.The Windows + C combination alerts Cortana to your vocal commands and the Windows + S combination alertsher to your written commands.",boost product save time window system support mani keyboard shortcutsy probabl know previou window version ctrl c ctrl x ctrl v use copi cut past itemsin video look main new old keyboard shortcutsth first one window key allow open close start menuif combin window key letter e file explor openth window key open window set window keysopen action centerth window r combin allowsy open run dialog boxwhich use launchappl exampley also use window spacebar key toggl write languagesfin window l combinationwil allow lock computerlet look manag open applic windowsto toggl window use alt key tab key choos window want displaysimilarli window tab key make possibl display open applic desktopsand close activ window use alt f4 combinationy also put window side bysid quickli use window left right arrow combinationto anchor window one side andthen choos window youwish anchor sidey take screenshot byus window print screen keysth screenshot automaticallysav pictur folderto see use window combin minim window display desktopth last two keyboard shortcutsthat look make possibl interact cortanath window c combin alert cortana vocal command window combin alertsh written command

I secure my identity,"-""Abracadabra!"" ""Supercalifragilis"" “Sim Sala Bim” ""Open Sesame!""-""What are you doing?""I'm looking for a way to secure my PC since other people will use it. I was told that the traditional password was outdated to enter a Windows 10 session... I’m trying something else, that's all! »Look here, I'll show you! Windows has diversified the ways in which one can log in. Choose a password and make sure to remember it well. It will be required to log into your session at least every time the computer starts. You can also define if it will be needed after the computer has gone to sleep for example. You will also be able to authenticate with a pin code or even protect your company’s data with another pin code to avoid other people stealing your identity and impersonating you on the network. With this system, the company’s data are isolated from others,some data is available by this PIN code, others are not, all without changing the environment or application!You can also choose an image and set several points on it in a certain order. It becomes your image code!- That’s quite a smart tip! Can I lend my computer to other people? I don’t need it all the time and I'd like to share the machine with my colleague but what will become of my files?- Of course, you can entrust your computer to other people in your family and Windows 10 will eventually make out the difference between a child and an adult, restricting access to certain inappropriate information.You can also share with other people, like a collaborator, just by entering their email address. Windows 10 will do the rest, while providing security. Your data will be fully protected and inaccessible by other users. If you're using your Microsoft account, you can even go as far as synchronizing your passwords and other settings on multiple devices using the same account like your smartphone for example. And of course, in all safety.-' Security, security... "". A real safe in which I can trust. It’s reassuring! The next step will surely biometrics!""Windows 10 has already made that available. With the Windows Hello application, it is possible to make a biometric authentication for your phone for example... Come on Matrix, you can sleep peacefully, your data will be well guarded!To overcome the constraint of the password that may not be very safe, too complicated to remember (especially after returning from vacation...) With Windows 10, other authentication modes are possible, Pin Code, biometrics... This time around, you become the password! Different levels are configurable, making the distinction between what is private and what is professional.

I use Cortana to be more productive,"- Any idea if the boss has hired a new assistant?- No, I don't think so!- He must be really exhausted then because I caught him talking to his computer and asking a certain Cortana to prepare his next meetings and itinerary to the airport!- Oh no, Cortana is not the boss's assistant, it is Windows 10’s personal assistant that helps you in your everyday life!- My assistant?- Sure, have a look!With Cortana, it’s easy to organize one’s daily life. From a simple search engine which helps find an app on the computer, this personal assistant will render you a whole lot of services. To properly set up your assistant, use the notebook. It is essential for Cortana to learn to know you so you can ask her a lot of things. From the weekend's sports results, to the stock market, through Victor Hugo’s bibliography... She finds everything!- If I need to find the meaning of a word in a sentence, can I ask her?- Of course! If while reading an article in Edge with the Windows 10 browser, you meet an unknown word, I suggest a little right-click on the word in question and you'll see that here too, Cortana is not far away!- I was far from imagining such.- And there’s more to it, you can ask her to call your contacts, to schedule an appointment, to put in place a reminder of the various tasks by starting your day at work, to prepare your itinerary, to keep you informed on the state of traffic before hitting the road or even the weather when you get off the plane to New Zealand or the United States!By whispering a little ""Hey Cortana"" to your computer, you don't need to enter a text, speech recognition works very well. You don't even need to search for a file among all your documents, ask Cortana!- I'm really very surprised of what Cortana can do to help me in my day-to-day organization. I will adopt this little gem! She looks lovely...- Don’t exaggerate... Anyway, if you plan on asking her to get your coffee, you might wait for a really long time.- Oh no... That’s your job!- Organize, remind, put in place, manage, inform, these are the main functions of Cortana, the intelligent personal assistant implemented in Windows 10.

General Introduction,"Every day business activitiesgenerate a copious amount of data.This data is generallydispersed in Excel, text and CSV files as well as in databases.However, in order to remain competitive and to increase their performance, small and large-scale businesses must use technologies to help them make better business decisions called businessintelligence in order to leverage this data.Business intelligencedesignates all the techniques andmethods that make itpossible to collect, organize and analyze data in an efficient manner.Once processed, this dataessentially becomes a dashboard for companies.This dashboard allowsleaders to get answers to their questions, to measure the outcome of their company's operations, to have indicators to better steer operations and finally to make better decisions.A number of tools are used to process data including Microsoft's analytics anddecision making suite called Power BI.Power BI is a system ofsoftware services, applicationsand connectors that worktogether to transform your datainto relevantinteractive information.Whatever the type andsource of your data, Power BI allows you to centralize and connect it in order to quickly produce reports anddashboards that are easy to use and share.The Power BI suiteconsists of a desktop applicationcalled Power BI Desktop that is used to produce all the reports you need, an online cloud service called Power BI Service to make it easier to communicate and share with dashboards as well as a mobile Power BI application available on phones, tablets and all system environments,allowing you toeasily monitor your data.This configuration makes itpossible to define a workflowin a logical orderstarting with Power BI Desktop.The first step in this flowconsists in connecting to a data source.This is followed by thedata preparation and modeling step, then by reportcreation and customization.Next comes the reportpublishing step in Power BI Servicefollowed by thecreation of dashboards.Finally, these dashboardscan be shared with other associates and can be consulted on Power BI Mobile.In conclusion, you shouldknow that Microsoft includesthree services inits Power BI package.The free Power BI Desktop application, which can be downloaded on the powerbi.microsoft.com site. Power BI Pro Service with a monthly pay-per-user license, Power BI Premium cloud service that assigns dedicatedworkspaces to a capacity instead of per user.This package is for big companieswith a very large number of users.",everi day busi activitiesgener copiou amount datathi data generallydispers excel text csv file well databaseshowev order remain competit increas perform small largescal busi must use technolog help make better busi decis call businessintellig order leverag databusi intelligencedesign techniqu andmethod make itposs collect organ analyz data effici manneronc process dataessenti becom dashboard companiesthi dashboard allowslead get answer question measur outcom compani oper indic better steer oper final make better decisionsa number tool use process data includ microsoft analyt anddecis make suit call power bipow bi system ofsoftwar servic applicationsand connector worktogeth transform datainto relevantinteract informationwhatev type andsourc data power bi allow central connect order quickli produc report anddashboard easi use shareth power bi suiteconsist desktop applicationcal power bi desktop use produc report need onlin cloud servic call power bi servic make easier commun share dashboard well mobil power bi applic avail phone tablet system environmentsallow toeasili monitor datathi configur make itposs defin workflowin logic orderstart power bi desktopth first step flowconsist connect data sourcethi follow thedata prepar model step reportcr customizationnext come reportpublish step power bi servicefollow thecreat dashboardsfin dashboardscan share associ consult power bi mobilein conclus shouldknow microsoft includesthre servic init power bi packageth free power bi desktop applic download powerbimicrosoftcom site power bi pro servic monthli payperus licens power bi premium cloud servic assign dedicatedworkspac capac instead per userthi packag big companieswith larg number user
Introduction to Power BI Desktop,"To follow up on the workflow that we presented in the previous video, we will now look at the Power BI Desktop application where this workflow originated.Power BI Desktop is whereyou will be spending most of your project time creating reports.Power BI Desktop allows youto connect to a wide range of data sources and to clean and formatyour data to make it easier to use.You can also createrelationships between the data, model it and view it in various ways.To obtain Power BI Desktop, you can download it from the website at powerbi.microsoft. com or from Power BI Service by clicking on the download button, the down arrow in the upper right corner and then by selecting Power BI Desktop.Once it has been installed andlaunched, a welcome screen will be displayed.From this screen, you can get data, consult recently used sources or open other reports.You will also find links totutorial videos, forums and the Power BI blog. If you no longer want this screen to be displayed when you start Power BI Desktop, check this box.Finally, if you close thewelcome screen, the Power BI 78Desktop report view will be displayed.Power BI Desktop offersthree views; Report, Data and Relationships.

Introduction to Power BI Building Blocks,"Any work with the Power BIsuite is done using a fewbasic elementscalled Building Blocks.Once you become familiarwith how they work, you will be able to begin creatingcomplex and elaborate reports.The basic building blocks ofPower BI are the following:Visualizations, Datasets, Reports,Dashboards and Tiles.A visualization, sometimescalled visual or visual tool,is a visual representation of data.It can be a diagram, agraph, a card or another visual representation of your data.Visualizations can besimple or visually complex.The goal is to presentdata in order to provideinformation and instructionsthat would otherwise be hardto understand in a rawnumber or text table.A dataset is a set of data thatPower BI uses to create visualizations.It can be a simple datasetbased on a single table or a combination of manydifferent sources, e.g. 3 database fields, awebsite table or an Excel table,which you can filter andarrange in order to create a single dataset tobe used in Power BI.This unique combination isalways considered as a single dataset, even though itcomes from various sources.Once the dataset has beencreated, you can begin tocreate visualizations that present the various parts of the dataset separately. A report is a set of visual tools from a dataset on one or more pages.Reports give you the option of creating a variety of visualizations, if necessaryon different pages, that you can arrange to optimize thepresentation of your data.In a report, all theelements are interlinked; you have the option to createreports either using Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.A dashboard is a singlepage that brings together a setof visual tools generatedfrom one or more reports.Often it is used to providea quick overview of data orpoints that you want to make.You can share dashboardswith other users or groups, who can then interact using Power BIService or their mobile device.Dashboards are an effectiveway to monitor your activity,to look for answers and to displayyour most important metrics at a glance.Indeed, the tiles are updatedas the underlying data changes.Dashboards are a feature ofPower BI Service and cannot be created with Power BIDesktop or with any mobile device.A tile is a single visualizationappearing in a report or a dashboard.It is the rectangular areathat contains each visual tool.When you create a report ora dashboard in Power BI, you can move or arrangethe tiles as you wish.You can make them largerby changing their height or width and you can bring themcloser together as you prefer.",work power bisuit done use fewbas elementscal build blocksonc becom familiarwith work abl begin creatingcomplex elabor reportsth basic build block ofpow bi followingvisu dataset reportsdashboard tilesa visual sometimescal visual visual tooli visual represent datait diagram agraph card anoth visual represent datavisu besimpl visual complexth goal presentdata order provideinform instructionsthat would otherwis hardto understand rawnumb text tablea dataset set data thatpow bi use creat visualizationsit simpl datasetbas singl tabl combin manydiffer sourc eg 3 databas field awebsit tabl excel tablewhich filter andarrang order creat singl dataset tobe use power bithi uniqu combin isalway consid singl dataset even though itcom variou sourcesonc dataset beencreat begin tocreat visual present variou part dataset separ report set visual tool dataset one pagesreport give option creat varieti visual necessaryon differ page arrang optim thepresent datain report theelement interlink option createreport either use power bi desktop power bi servicea dashboard singlepag bring togeth setof visual tool generatedfrom one reportsoften use providea quick overview data orpoint want makey share dashboardswith user group interact use power biservic mobil devicedashboard effectiveway monitor activityto look answer displayyour import metric glanceinde tile updateda underli data changesdashboard featur ofpow bi servic creat power bidesktop mobil devicea tile singl visualizationappear report dashboardit rectangular areathat contain visual toolwhen creat report ora dashboard power bi move arrangeth tile wishyou make largerbi chang height width bring themclos togeth prefer
Creating your Datasets,"After these few introductory videos, it is now time tobegin the workflowas previously defined.The first step consists in getting data to create the data set that you are goingto use in Power BI Desktop.When you launch Power BI Desktop, you can click on Get Data on the welcomescreen to begin connecting it to data.If you have already gonepast the welcome screen, you can select Get Data under the Home tab.The various data sourceswill then be displayed and you will be able to choose one.Power BI Desktop can connectto a series of data sources,data files, databases, online services, webpages, etc. It also allows you to create data directly by choosing Blank Query.You can also connect to afolder to import data fromseveral files at a time.Select a source and then click on Connect to establish a connection.Depending on yourselection, you will be invited tosearch for the source onyour computer or network or to connect to a service toauthenticate your query.Finally, regardless of thedata source you choose, Power BI will connect to this sourceand present the available data.Once Power BI is connected,the Navigator window will appear.The Navigator will displaythe tables or entities of your data source and you can click on one of them to get an overview of its content.Once you have selected the tables that you wish to import into Power BI Desktop, you will be given two options.You can choose to import them directly by selecting the Load button in the lower right corner of the navigator or you can select Edit to make changes to these tables and filter the data before it is imported into Power BI Desktop.That way, you can limit thedata to what interests you.In this case, the QueryEditor which we will introduce in the following videos will open.Finally, Power BI Desktopcan combine data from several sources into one report.To add sources to anexisting report, select Edit Queries under the Home tab, then select New Source in the Query Editor.The Get Data window will open.You can then repeat the dataimport operations that were presented previously.",introductori video time tobegin workflowa previous definedth first step consist get data creat data set goingto use power bi desktopwhen launch power bi desktop click get data welcomescreen begin connect dataif alreadi gonepast welcom screen select get data home tabth variou data sourceswil display abl choos onepow bi desktop connectto seri data sourcesdata file databas onlin servic webpag etc also allow creat data directli choos blank queryy also connect afold import data fromsever file timeselect sourc click connect establish connectiondepend yourselect invit tosearch sourc onyour comput network connect servic toauthent queryfin regardless thedata sourc choos power bi connect sourceand present avail dataonc power bi connectedth navig window appearth navig displayth tabl entiti data sourc click one get overview contentonc select tabl wish import power bi desktop given two optionsy choos import directli select load button lower right corner navig select edit make chang tabl filter data import power bi desktopthat way limit thedata interest youin case queryeditor introduc follow video openfin power bi desktopcan combin data sever sourc one reportto add sourc anexist report select edit queri home tab select new sourc queri editorth get data window openy repeat dataimport oper present previous
Recovering your Data from different sources,"In the previous video, we saw a simple example of how to connect to an Excel file. In this video, we will look at more examples of how to recover data from different sources.Let's begin by getting datadirectly from a website URL.In this example, we want tocapture this results chartfrom the Nasdaq website. In the Get Data window, click on Other and then on Web.When you click on Connect, awindow will open and ask forthe URL of the relevant website, copy and paste the link from your navigator and select OK.Power BI Desktop willcontact the web resource and the Navigator window will retrievewhat it found on this webpage.In this case, it found ninetables in the entire web document.Table 3 is the one that interests us.Select it in the listto display an overview.You can toggle to Web View tomake sure you choose the right table.Click on Load to complete the import.Another common way to get data isby connecting to online services.In my case, I'm going toconnect to a SharePoint list,but the procedure is similarfor all other online services.In the Get Data window,click on Online Services and then choose SharePoint Online List.When you click on Connect,a window will display whereyou will need to enter theURL of the SharePoint site.Next select OK.

Introduction to the Query Editor,"When you import data,most of the time, it is not presented or set up asyou would like it to be.To help you format andtransform your data, Power BI Desktop includes apowerful tool called Query Editor.Query Editor makes itpossible to create queries, change names, transform data types, extract data, create new columns and apply edits.Query Editor opens in aseparate window with the tablesthat you chose when youselected Edit during the data import.Otherwise you can launchit at anytime using the Edit Queries button under the Home tab.Once Query Editor has been loadedwith data, several sections will appear.The ribbon, which makes itpossible to interact with the query data, for example, by modifying the column data type, extracting elements and replacing values.The left pane called Queries lists all the tables available for selecting,displaying and formatting.A Power BI table is called a query.In the middle pane, the datafrom the selected request is displayed and available for editing.The Query Settings pane of arequest lists the propertiesand the steps applied duringthe transformation procedure.Each operation performed inQuery Editor is displayed inthe Applied Steps list inthe Query Settings pane.You can use this list tocancel, delete or review specific edits or even change the name of a step.You can also right click toperform quick actions, for example, right clicking on acolumn makes it possible to display a series ofavailable transformations such as deleting a table column,copying a column under a new name and replacing values.In this menu, you can also splittext columns using common delimiters.To save your transformations,select Close Apply under the Home tab.Once you have selected Close Apply, Query Editor will apply the query edits that you made and will then apply them to Power BI Desktop.Finally, don't hesitate to explore the features made available to you under the various tabs to achievethe desired data editing, for example, you can use theAppend Queries tool to add datafrom a new table to anexisting query or the Add Custom Column tool that allows experienced users to write query expressions using the powerful M language.",import datamost time present set asyou would like beto help format andtransform data power bi desktop includ apow tool call queri editorqueri editor make itposs creat queri chang name transform data type extract data creat new column appli editsqueri editor open asepar window tablesthat chose youselect edit data importotherwis launchit anytim use edit queri button home tabonc queri editor loadedwith data sever section appearth ribbon make itposs interact queri data exampl modifi column data type extract element replac valuesth left pane call queri list tabl avail selectingdisplay formattinga power bi tabl call queryin middl pane datafrom select request display avail editingth queri set pane arequest list propertiesand step appli duringth transform procedureeach oper perform inqueri editor display inth appli step list inth queri set paney use list tocancel delet review specif edit even chang name stepyou also right click toperform quick action exampl right click acolumn make possibl display seri ofavail transform delet tabl columncopi column new name replac valuesin menu also splittext column use common delimitersto save transformationsselect close appli home tabonc select close appli queri editor appli queri edit made appli power bi desktopfin dont hesit explor featur made avail variou tab achieveth desir data edit exampl use theappend queri tool add datafrom new tabl anexist queri add custom column tool allow experienc user write queri express use power languag
"Preparing, cleaning and transforming your Data","In this video, we'regoing to use a few features available in Query Editorto prepare the dataset thatwill be used to produce a report.Let's begin by importing data.In this example, I'm going to use an Excel file for sales management that contains 704 rows.As we mentioned previously, most of the time, imported data is not properlyformatted or is not ready to use.For instance, in the Country column, only the first line of each section contains the name of the country.For Power BI to analyzesales by country, I need to fill in each row with thecorresponding value.To do so, I go to the Transformtab and then I use Fill, Descending.There are still a few rows in the header of each section that contain null values. I right click on one of these values, then on Text Filters andthen on Does Not Equal to delete it.You will notice that PowerBI automatically detects the data type such as text, decimal number or whole number.To change the data type ina column, simply select the column and then chooseData Type under the Home tab.I am interested only inEuropean sales, I will therefore delete the rows that list US sales.These rows start at row561 and end at row 700, which gives us 140 lines.There are two ways to delete them.Either you can use the KeepRows command then Keep Top Rows and specify the numberof rows to keep such as 561,or you can use the RemoveRows command, then Remove Bottom Rows and specify the number of rows to delete,which is 140 in our case.The Month Number, Month Name and Years columns are not useful to me as the Datecolumn is all I need for now.I select these columns byholding down the Ctrl key, and then I choose RemoveColumns under the Home tab.You can also split acolumn into several columns.Let's use our date example once again; there are a few methods that you can use.Let's start with the Split Columncommand and choose By Delimiter.Power BI will automatically detect the delimiter,otherwise you can usethe list to choose one.The second method is to createseveral columns starting from this one.Go to the Add Column tab andchoose Column From Examplesand then From Selection.Double click on one ofthe cells in the new column.Power BI will displayall the available choices.Select the one that suits you best.You can see that the columnhas been filled in, click on OK to confirm thecreation of this new column.I now want to change themanufacturing value of this product in the Manufacturing Price column.To do so, I select a cellthat contains the value to be changed, next, under the Home tabI use the Replace Values command.I enter the new value and I confirmthe information by clicking on OK.While looking at my chart, I notice that it was missing a column for actual sales. To add this column, I'm going to use the Custom Column command under the Add Column tab.I give my column a nameand then I enter my formula.The actual sales arecalculated by subtracting the discount value from the sales total.By double clicking on thenames of the columns to add them, I can see that noerrors were found in my formula.I can now confirm by clicking on OK.I'm going to changethe type of my columnand then place itafter the Discounts column.To make it easier toanalyze the data, I'm going to create a final column thatwill display Yes to indicate a gain and No to indicate a loss.To do so, I can use theConditional Column command.This command correspondsto the IF function in Excel.I select the Profit column,I define ""is greater than"" as an operator, ""0"" as a value, ""Yes"" in Output and ""No"" in Otherwise.The dataset is nowready to be analyzed.All that remains is toapply the edits that we made by clicking on CloseApply under the Home tab.Finally, most of thefeatures offered by Query Editor arealso available by rightclicking with your mouse.",video werego use featur avail queri editorto prepar dataset thatwil use produc reportlet begin import datain exampl im go use excel file sale manag contain 704 rowsa mention previous time import data properlyformat readi usefor instanc countri column first line section contain name countryfor power bi analyzesal countri need fill row thecorrespond valueto go transformtab use fill descendingther still row header section contain null valu right click one valu text filter andthen equal delet ityou notic powerbi automat detect data type text decim number whole numberto chang data type ina column simpli select column choosedata type home tabi interest ineuropean sale therefor delet row list us salesthes row start row561 end row 700 give us 140 linesther two way delet themeith use keeprow command keep top row specifi numberof row keep 561or use removerow command remov bottom row specifi number row deletewhich 140 caseth month number month name year column use datecolumn need nowi select column byhold ctrl key choos removecolumn home tabyou also split acolumn sever columnslet use date exampl method uselet start split columncommand choos delimiterpow bi automat detect delimiterotherwis useth list choos oneth second method createsever column start onego add column tab andchoos column examplesand selectiondoubl click one ofth cell new columnpow bi displayal avail choicesselect one suit bestyou see columnha fill click ok confirm thecreat new columni want chang themanufactur valu product manufactur price columnto select cellthat contain valu chang next home tabi use replac valu commandi enter new valu confirmth inform click okwhil look chart notic miss column actual sale add column im go use custom column command add column tabi give column nameand enter formulath actual sale arecalcul subtract discount valu sale totalbi doubl click thenam column add see noerror found formulai confirm click okim go changeth type columnand place itaft discount columnto make easier toanalyz data im go creat final column thatwil display ye indic gain indic lossto use thecondit column commandthi command correspondsto function exc select profit columni defin greater oper 0 valu ye output otherwiseth dataset nowreadi analyzedal remain toappli edit made click closeappli home tabfin thefeatur offer queri editor arealso avail rightclick mous
Creating a Report,"Once you have finishedpreparing your dataset,you can now begin creating reports.When closing Query Editor,you will come to the Report view,which in our case will be a blank page.To represent your data,Power BI offers all kinds ofattractive visuals whichyou can customize as you wish.You can also purchase othervisuals from Microsoft Storeor import personal visual from files.There are various ways tocreate visuals on Power BI Desktop.You can simply drag fieldnames from the fields paneand then drop them on the report canvas.By selecting the Sales fieldfor example,you will notice that Power BI will analyze thedata type and suggest a suitable visual.I'm going to check the Country field toget more details about sales by country.You can also click on the type of visualsto be created inthe Visualizations pane.In this case, the defaultvisual is a blank reserved spacethat looks like thetype of visual you have selected.You can begin to drag datafields onto the lower part ofthe Visualizations pane tocreate and organize your visual.However, if you have anydoubts or if you're thinking of dropping a field,the simplest solution is todrag the field directly into the visual.Power BI will takecare of the restor you can simply checkthe box next to the field.The totals of the sales bysegment will now be displayed.depending on the type of visual selected.Also when you drag anddrop other data fields,the visuals are automaticallyupdated to reflect the changes.If you want to remove a field,all you need to do isuncheck the corresponding box.To enrich our report, let'sadd more visualssuch as a tile with thetotal amount of sales,another one with thetotal number of units soldand another one with details on sales by monthand the last tile withdetails on sales by product.We have obtained all thevisuals we were looking for.All that is left to do now isto organize them on the page.You can also resize a visualby selecting it and draggingthe handles inward or outward.You can also move your visualanywhere on the drawing area.If you want to convertyour visuals from one type to another,you can alsoselect the visual you wish to changeand simply selectanother visual from the iconsin your Visualizations pane.Finally, if you point yourcursor on a section of your visuals,a help balloon willdisplay details on that segmentsuch as the total sales bysegment and the sales by percentage.",finishedprepar datasety begin creat reportswhen close queri editory come report viewwhich case blank pageto repres datapow bi offer kind ofattract visual whichyou custom wishyou also purchas othervisu microsoft storeor import person visual filesther variou way tocreat visual power bi desktopy simpli drag fieldnam field paneand drop report canvasbi select sale fieldfor exampley notic power bi analyz thedata type suggest suitabl visualim go check countri field toget detail sale countryy also click type visualsto creat inth visual panein case defaultvisu blank reserv spacethat look like thetyp visual selectedy begin drag datafield onto lower part ofth visual pane tocreat organ visualhowev anydoubt your think drop fieldth simplest solut todrag field directli visualpow bi takecar restor simpli checkth box next fieldth total sale byseg displayeddepend type visual selectedalso drag anddrop data fieldsth visual automaticallyupd reflect changesif want remov fieldal need isuncheck correspond boxto enrich report letsadd visualssuch tile thetot amount salesanoth one thetot number unit soldand anoth one detail sale monthand last tile withdetail sale productw obtain thevisu look foral left isto organ pagey also resiz visualbi select draggingth handl inward outwardy also move visualanywher draw areaif want convertyour visual one type anothery alsoselect visual wish changeand simpli selectanoth visual iconsin visual panefin point yourcursor section visualsa help balloon willdisplay detail segmentsuch total sale byseg sale percentag
Customising your Visuals,"Now that you have finishedgenerating visuals, you can begin to customize them.Depending on the type of visual selected, the number of available buckets in the Visualizations Pane will change. If you look at it more closely, you will notice that each bucket contains a piece of information.You will get more information byhovering your mouse over a bucket.several files into one bucket as long as the data islogically connected.As a general rule, Power BI automatically adds up the values of a field, but you can adjust the way these values are summarized by clicking on the down arrow to the right of a name and then choosing the method to use to summarize the values. You can also select the relevant field in the Fields pane and use the various options under theModeling tab on the ribbon,such as the Formatting Optionsfor data and data properties.You can then change the symboltype; monetary, percentage, etc., and the way Power BImust summarize the data.Similarly, in the Filter section, you can drag several fields into one bucket.When you click on one of the filters, other filter options will be displayed.For instance, I can choose to display only sales for the fourth quarter.Now let's look at theDisplay and Aspect Editing Options.To begin, select thevisual and then in the Visualizations pane, activate the Format pane by clicking on the paintbrush icon.Many options are available to change the colors or formatting of a visual.These options vary fromone visual to another.You can then enable, disableand customize each of these options such as the legend, detail labels, visual title and background. You can also change the colors of each data item, create a border around the visual and specify what color this border should be.In the last sectionentitled General, you will find positioning and sizeoptions for the selected visual.Another very practicalprocess is available for certain visuals such as histograms.It consists in defining a constantline sometimes called a reference line.To do so, select theAnalytics pane and then develop the Constant Line section and finally click on Add.You can then definethe constant line valueand define itscolor, style and positionand you can eveninclude a data label.Finally, you will find several other lines in the Analytics pane such as themin, max, average, median and percentile lines.",finishedgener visual begin custom themdepend type visual select number avail bucket visual pane chang look close notic bucket contain piec informationy get inform byhov mous bucketsever file one bucket long data islog connecteda gener rule power bi automat add valu field adjust way valu summar click arrow right name choos method use summar valu also select relev field field pane use variou option themodel tab ribbonsuch format optionsfor data data propertiesy chang symboltyp monetari percentag etc way power bimust summar datasimilarli filter section drag sever field one bucketwhen click one filter filter option displayedfor instanc choos display sale fourth quarternow let look thedisplay aspect edit optionsto begin select thevisu visual pane activ format pane click paintbrush iconmani option avail chang color format visualthes option vari fromon visual anothery enabl disableand custom option legend detail label visual titl background also chang color data item creat border around visual specifi color border bein last sectionentitl gener find posit sizeopt select visualanoth practicalprocess avail certain visual histogramsit consist defin constantlin sometim call refer lineto select theanalyt pane develop constant line section final click addyou defineth constant line valueand defin itscolor style positionand eveninclud data labelfin find sever line analyt pane themin max averag median percentil line
Customising your Report,"In addition to the toolsthat are available to customize visuals, Power BI Desktopalso has a wide range of toolsto format the pages of yourreport and help you bring it to life.Besides data relatedvisuals, you can also add static elements such as text, boxes images and shapes to improve the visual design of your reports.To add these elements, go to theInsert Group under the Home tab.Text boxes are ideal fordisplaying large titles, legendsor short informationparagraphs with your visuals.To include a link in a textbox, select the relevant textand then click on the Linksymbol in the text box option bar.You can select image toopen the File Explorer in orderto select an imagefrom your computer.With respect to Shapes, youhave five options; rectangle, oval, line, triangle and arrow.The shapes can be opaque ortransparent with a colored border.When you select thesestatic elements, the Format pane will be displayed to the right and will allow you to customize them.Now let's look atthe body of the page.Make sure that no visualhas been selected and then enable the Format pane byclicking on the Paintbrush icon.You can then rename the page, change the background color and even set an image as the background if you wish.You could also change the page size.By default, reportpages have a 16 by 9 ratio.To change the page size, select one of the available options in the type list.The available sizes are 4 by 3,Letter and Cortana.This letter option allowsyou to resize the report sothat it can be used as anoutcome in research using Cortana.Finally, the Custom optionmakes it possible to specify a custom size in pixels.You may have to resize yourvisuals after changing the page size, so that theyare visible on the canvas.You can also change thepage scaling of your report.To do so, use the PageView menu under the View tab.If you plan to share orconsult your report on a smartphone, you must go to Phone Layout to define the layout of your visuals in this Page View.Finally, as we mentioned earlier, areport can contain several pages.To add a new page, click on theplus sign in the Page Tabs area.However, if you want to usethe same layouts and visualsas on the first page, simplycopy it by right clicking on the tab and then selectDuplicate Page, you can then rename the new page andmake the necessary updates.",addit toolsthat avail custom visual power bi desktopalso wide rang toolsto format page yourreport help bring lifebesid data relatedvisu also add static element text box imag shape improv visual design reportsto add element go theinsert group home tabtext box ideal fordisplay larg titl legendsor short informationparagraph visualsto includ link textbox select relev textand click linksymbol text box option baryou select imag toopen file explor orderto select imagefrom computerwith respect shape youhav five option rectangl oval line triangl arrowth shape opaqu ortranspar color borderwhen select thesestat element format pane display right allow custom themnow let look atth bodi pagemak sure visualha select enabl format pane byclick paintbrush icony renam page chang background color even set imag background wishyou could also chang page sizebi default reportpag 16 9 ratioto chang page size select one avail option type listth avail size 4 3letter cortanathi letter option allowsy resiz report sothat use anoutcom research use cortanafin custom optionmak possibl specifi custom size pixelsy may resiz yourvisu chang page size theyar visibl canvasy also chang thepag scale reportto use pageview menu view tabif plan share orconsult report smartphon must go phone layout defin layout visual page viewfin mention earlier areport contain sever pagesto add new page click theplu sign page tab areahowev want useth layout visualsa first page simplycopi right click tab selectdupl page renam new page andmak necessari updat

Creating and configuring a Dashboard,"Now that we have navigatedthe Power BI Service, we will look more closely in thisvideo at how to create a dashboard.As a reminder, dashboardsare powerful tools that allow you to see at a glance all the information you need to make decisions and to monitor the most important information about your activities. To create a dashboard, go to the Reports section of My Workspace, and select the report that wepublished earlier from Power BI Desktop.In this report, place your cursor over the visual that you would like to pin and then select this icon to pin the visual to a dashboard.A dialogue box will open,or you can pin the visualto an existing dashboard or create a new dashboard.In our case, the existing dashboard option is grayed out because no dashboard has been created in our workspace as of yet.Name your dashboardand then click on Pin.A message will be displayedat the top right of your pageto inform you that yourvisual has been pinned.You can take advantage ofthis to create a Phone View of your dashboard or to access it.Continue pinning other visuals, but this time choose Existing Dashboard and in the dropdown list select the dashboard that we created earlier.You can pin visuals fromdifferent reports and pages or even from other dashboards.For example, you can do thisif you have a collection of dashboards and you wantto create a summary table.Once a visual has been pinned toa dashboard, it is called a tile.Your dashboards including the new ones will appear in the Dashboards section of your workspace.Select a dashboard fromthe list to display it.You can also add specialtiles that instead of containing a visual will contain otherelements such as an image, an online video, a text boxor enriched web content.To do so, click on Add Tile in themenu at the top of your dashboard.The Details Pane willopen where you can edit the information as youwould for any other tile.You can also define acustom link to redirect your associates and create a new navigation path when they click on the relevant tile.

Survey Your Teams on the New Digital Tools,"You are seriously thinking about implementing new digital tools in your organization. You would like your associates’ opinion on the subject and, above all, you would like them to take part in this initiative. Which tools will you use to collect these opinions? You want this survey to remain anonymous in order to ensure greatest transparency. How will you ensure that people can access the questionnaire that you will develop? And how will you then analyse the results? Microsoft Forms allows you to easily complete many tasks. for my survey on digital tools? For my survey on digital tools, I am going to create a new form.You can find Forms in the list of applications, unless your administrator has unchecked this tool for your organization. With just a few clicks, I will put together a questionnaire, without having any special knowledge. First, I will name the questionnaire and then I will add an image that I had prepared.Designing the questionnaire will then take only a few minutes. All question types are possible: multiple answers, single choice, open-ended questions, rating, etc.Once the questionnaire has been completed, I will ask the Forms application to suggest a few themes for the design. This one, for example, matches our graphic charter. It suits me very well. Finally, I will be able to recover the link.In my case, I will choose the “Only people in my organization can respond” option, because I don’t want people outside of our organization to use this link. In my case, I will post the link on my intranet so that the people concerned can respond to the questionnaire.All they need to do is click on the link. And since they will be connected to their Office 365 space, the questionnaire will be displayed directly. The results will then be visible in my Forms space, in the results section. Here, I can see the number of participants and a summary of the responses.If I would like to go further in processing the responses, I can open an Excel file that will allow me to customize my analysis. Using Forms, I was able to create a form without having any special skills. The questionnaire is shared using a simple link.

Having Your Own Video Stream Channel,"You are in charge of training in your company. You want to make video content available but you are not sure how to go about it. You want to control access to these videos so you can offer them only to a select group of people in your company. Will you need to go through an external service such as YouTube or Vimeo?Will you need to set up a video streaming server in your company? You know that is a bit heavy... Office 365 includes a video streaming service. I'm going to select Stream in the list of Office 365 applications. I'm going to set up a training video channel in a few minutesand make it available to a limited group of people. Ideally we would use an Office 365 group to limit access and make these videos available. To do this I can go to Create and then to Create a group in order to create a group of people directly in Stream or to create a channel if the group already exists.In Creating a channel, I will select the Group channel option. This allows me to link this channel to an existing Office 365 Group. By doing a search, it is possible to find a group that was previously created in Teams or Outlook.The channel has now been created. The next step is to upload the videos to the channel simply by dragging and dropping them. While doing so I make sure that this option has been unchecked, so that only the people in the group can watch the videos. Once the videos have been uploaded they must be published.Now I will make these videos available to the group members. To do this I'm going to use Teams. In the relevant channel, I'm going to add a Stream tab.All I need to do is paste the URL for the channel I created and that's it. Only the members of this group will be able to view the videos.For my part, on the Stream page, I will be able to track the viewing statistics, the likes and comments. With Stream, you can put video content online in a few minutes. You can easily control access to these videos by creating your own channels and using Office groups.",charg train compani want make video content avail sure go want control access video offer select group peopl compani need go extern servic youtub vimeowil need set video stream server compani know bit heavi offic 365 includ video stream servic im go select stream list offic 365 applic im go set train video channel minutesand make avail limit group peopl ideal would use offic 365 group limit access make video avail go creat creat group order creat group peopl directli stream creat channel group alreadi existsin creat channel select group channel option allow link channel exist offic 365 group search possibl find group previous creat team outlookth channel creat next step upload video channel simpli drag drop make sure option uncheck peopl group watch video video upload must publishednow make video avail group member im go use team relev channel im go add stream tabal need past url channel creat that member group abl view videosfor part stream page abl track view statist like comment stream put video content onlin minut easili control access video creat channel use offic group

Discover the visual tool for decision support,"Welcome in this presentation of Power BI. In the first part of this presentation, I would like to explain to you the purpose of Power BI. Then we will go to Power BI Desktop in order to create our first report. We will publish it and we will share it from Power BI service.2Before everything else, let's explain what Power BI is. Power BI is a free business analytics service for aggregating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data. You can create reports and dashboards by yourself without having to depend on information technology staff3or database administrators. Then you can share and collaborate in any reports or dashboards with your coworkers.4Power BI consists in a Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online service called Power BI service and Power BI mobile applications. This 3 elements, the Desktop version, the service version and the mobile application version, have been designed to allow you5to create, share and consume business data, according to your needs. The common activity flow into Power BI is to first integrate data into Power BI Desktop and create our first report. Then we will publish the report in the Power BI Service, where we can generate dashboards.6We will share our dashboard with others from Power BI service and will view shared reports and dashboards in the Power BI mobile apps. We will see later that it's possible to create your visualizations directly from Power BI Desktop and you can also create reports from Power BI online service.7Just to let you know, to create a report it's recommended to use Power BI Desktop because you have more advanced analysis tools for your data.8So now let's go to Power BI Desktop to create our first report.9Welcome in Power BI Desktop. As always in the Office applications, we find tabs and ribbons at the top of the page to find our features.10Our first step will be to add some data from the Get Data button. I will select the More button to show you all the connectors available.11As you can see, there are many that you can use to get data. It can be, for example, from an Excel file, a SharePoint folder, an access database, an Azure database, a Salesforce account, etc. In my example, I will select an Excel file.12Once we have selected our Excel file, I need to select the good days because, potentially, I could have more than one base in the same document. So this is a good base I want to use. I can click on the Load button.13Once we have loaded our data, we can see now that the pane Fields on the right side is full of data. I need to repeat the operation to add a second database. So we click again on the Get Data button and then on Excel.14As you can see, there are two tabs in my Excel document so I will pick the good one, the first one, with the data I need. I can now load the data and once again, I will see the data from the pane Fields on the right side.15If needed, we can sort and filter our data from the data tab using the re-editor.16Let me show you that. From the left pane, there is a second icon Data where we can edit our data. For example, if all the data in the database is not useful for my coworkers. What can I do? I can just click on the Edit Queries button from the ribbon and17I will be able to manage everything for my data. For example, in my example, I just don't want to see Product number 4. I just don't want to see this column and as you can see I can remove it. I can also just sort my names18in an ascending way, for example. So you can make all the modifications you need. Once you are done sorting and filtering data don't forget to close and apply your modifications.19Next step before creating our first visualization. We need to create a relationship between our two tables to cross the data. You can do that, from the left pane in the third icon Relationships or we can do that also from the ribbon. There is a button here Manage Relashionships.20 21If you already use Power Pivot from Excel, you won't be lost. It's more or less the same way to use it.22In fact, in most cases, you won't have to do anything. You have right here the Autodetect feature. We can do it for you. If you do that, cardinality, cross-filter direction and active properties are automatically set up. You don't need to do anything.23However, in some cases, you may have to create relationships yourself or you may need to make some changes to a relationship. In this case you can click on the New button.24In this window, you may have to create a relationship.25In this window, in the first table drop-down list,26select a table, for example the first one.27Then select the color you want to use to make the link between your two tables.28So I'm going to select the other value right here. For example, first name with first name.29I can now click on OK. Just for your information, visit the first presentation of Power BI so we won't speak, we won't develop the options of cardinality and cross filter directions. I can now validate my relationship and as you can see it is all setup.30I can close this window. We are ready to create our first visualizations in our report. So let's come back to the first tab.31Our report and as I said there are many pages in your report. By default we only have one, as you can see I am on the first page. But if I need it I can create any pages I need by clicking on this symbol, the Plus.32I will select visualizations and data, according to my needs. For example, some charts right here. And as you can see once I select the visualizations, this visualization is empty. This is normal, I didn't select any data.33That's why now, I need to go in the Fields pane to select the good data I would like to to see in these visualizations. For example, I would like to see all the sales of my products34 35for my team, so for example, I can fill all the products sold by my team right here. I'm just going to add some visualizations to give you more examples. I'm going to add another one for example, this time, we will choose a clustered column chart and this time, I would like to see36my sales by managers.37You know there are two managers, I can see each sale by managers. What can we add more? We will add pie charts for example, for the demonstration38with product 2 and product 3. That's it. And finally I would like to just add a map. It will be easier for me to understand how I made my sales. So once again I need to select some data for the map. I will select, for example, the cities and39the names of my coworkers. That's it.40What is really good about the way to create a report is you can just customize and set up everything you need. As we can see I can just reduce or expand visualizations. I can also for example, change the data. By default, I have a sum.41If I want an average, it's possible. Just let me show you that. If you want to customize or configure any visualization just click on it, and then from the Visualizations pane, you will find 3 tabs: Fields, Format and Analytics. From the 3 tabs, you will be able to manage42your visualizations if you want to add a background, a caption. If you want to change the style of your chart, if you want to change anything, you can do it from here. Just remember that this is really useful. As I said, by default, we have a sum but we could change our data43to get the minimum, the maximum or just an average. Just remember that this is really useful to use that but this kind of features are not available for Power BI service. Because we can create a report from Power BI Service, but some features won't be available.44This is a good example.45What you have to know about visualizations is that the display is totaly dynamic. For example, I can select a specific city on my map, for example, Madrid and I will see all the other visualizations adjusted according to what I selected in my map.46So for example, if I just select Madrid, I will see only the sales of my coworkes done in Madrid.47On the contrary, I could select directly someone from my first visualizations. For example, Mr. Duval. If I click on the Duval name, I will see only the place where I sold some products and I will see only the manager for whom he is working. In my example it is Jean-Yves.48So just remember that any displays for visualizations are dynamic. This is really good, but just to give you this information: this is true for reports, this is not true for dashboards. Just remember that. I will show you that later.49As I said, we can customize also any visualizations, change the values of the captions, etc., from the Visualizations pane.50I could go on and create several pages on my report. Let's imagine we just finished and we are ready to publish our report and to share it with our coworkers. If I want to publish our report on Power BI service, I need to click on the Publish button in the ribbon.51I will say yes, I want to save my changes and then I will name this report.52Once it's saved, I will have the opportunity to publish it into my workspace. I will show you that in a few seconds or into any SharePoint site or Teams site. Just for information, it's possible to publish any report into SharePoint or in Teams, I will select53my workspace and normally once it's done, I should see a link to reach directly Power BI service. That's perfect. I succeeded to publish my report and now I can open it from Power BI.54Let me show you that. Welcome to Power BI service and now let me explain a bit how to use Power BI service. As you can see, I can see my report right here and I will be able, if I need it, to share it from the ribbon. There is a button Share right here.55So first thing I would like to show you. Let's see a bit of the left pane. You will find all your favorites and your apps. What is an app? It's a collection of dashboards and reports. It's just a good place to easily find your reports and56most used dashboards. Just to let you know.57From my workspace, I will be able to consult any dashboard, report, workbook and dataset I get into Power BI. As we can see, if I go in Reports, I should be able to see the report I just created with you.58Let me give you some information about the sharing. If you want to share a report, you can open your report and do it directly from the report or you can do it from this page.59If, for example, we want to share the first report, I will use the second icon Share. What you have to know about sharing. Whether you shared content is inside or outside the organization, you need a Power BI Pro license.60Your recipients also need the Power BI Pro license or the content needs to be in a premium capacity. This is a special version to allow any people who doesn't have a Power BI Pro license to display your report and to share your report with them. I won't give you more details about it61but just to let you know it's possible. To summarize, you can use Power BI for free. But if you need to share your report or dashboards, you need a Power BI Pro license or you need to create a report in premium capacity.62 63So when you share a dashboard or report, those you share it with can view it and interact with it but the can't edit. They see exactly the same data that you can see in your dashboard or report.64The coworkers you share with can also share with their coworkers if you allow them to. Let me show you that: if I click on the Share button, there is a box Allow recipients to share your report.65 66People outside your organization can view and interact with the dashboard or report but they can't share it. So this box, Allow recipients to share your report, is only for internal people. If you just share report with someone external, they won't be able to share it to someone else, just to let you know.67 68So let's share it. I'm going to add an email address for my coworker, for example Chad, and I'm going to click on the Share button.69Now that my report is shared my colleague Chad can consult it on Power BI mobile, apps or service. We could also have created a specific dashboard for Chad to select only the relevant visualizations for him. So let me show you that: if you want to create any dashboard or report from Power BI service,70we will use the Create better from the ribbon. Then I will choose Dashboard and will name my dashboard.71Once it's created I'm ready to add some visualizations on it. To do that, I need to select my reports, my visualizations from the report. And for example, if I want to add this visualization to my dashboard, I just have to click on72the Pin icon right here and then I will need to choose in which dashboard I want to pin it. So it will be, for example, the dashboard we just created together. I'm going to pin these visualizations. Let's pin another one,73for example this one. Once again I will click on the Pin Visual icon and then I will pin it to my dashboard. That's it. Let's come back to our dashboard to be sure that we can see our visualizations. Yes, we can, that's great, we can see it. Just remember that, as I said, this is a dashboard it means that74visualizations are not dynamic. If I click on one of my visualizations, I will just open the report directly. It is just like a link, like a shortcut to the report. So remember that.75The display is dynamic on the report and not on the dashboard. Just to let you know, it is really important to know that.76Now we know how to create the first report. We know how to import some data. We know also how to create a dashboard and share it with our coworkers. To conclude this presentation, know that Power BI is a really powerful and complete tool. We didn't see all the possibilities of use.77This presentation was intended to make you understand the utility of Power BI, and give you the basics to get started with Power BI.78Thank you very much

Reduce the number of emails in the company,"Today, many emails are still being sent in your company.You want to change these habitsas sometimes replies are delayed,inboxes are getting overloaded andthere is not enough time to reply.In addition, everyone stores these emails in their inbox, when all this information could be leveraged.But how should you go about it to encourage your colleagues to adopt this approach?You are afraid that communicationswill be less effective.Why not take advantage of a new project launch as an incentive for your colleagues to use Teams?Let’s see how Teams can help you.Teams is a workspace that improves collaboration.Setting up a team is very quick and simple.The team can then include several discussion channels that you can create to compartmentalise discussions.Here, for example, I’m takingadvantage of a new project in whichI will create different discussionchannels around a particular topic.It’s these discussion channels that will allow you to lower the number of emails in the company.In these discussion spaces, each member can send important information to other members.They can ask open-ended questions, reply to questions, etc.The advantage is that you can leverage the exchanges and retrieve the discussion thread at any time.Finally, if you want to converse with other people outside of the channel, this is entirely possible.Simply go to the “Chat” tab, andthen enter one or more names.Here, the discussion is limitedto the people you have invited.All you need to do then is to choosethe right tool, the channel, when you want to share information witha team, the “Chat” tab when you want to have a one-on-one talk or an exchange with other people from more than one team.To summarise, Teams will allow youto centralise exchanges.You will automatically reduce thenumber of messages in your inboxes.And you will be leveraging knowledge!",today mani email still sent companyy want chang habitsa sometim repli delayedinbox get overload andther enough time replyin addit everyon store email inbox inform could leveragedbut go encourag colleagu adopt approachy afraid communicationswil less effectivewhi take advantag new project launch incent colleagu use teamslet see team help youteam workspac improv collaborationset team quick simpleth team includ sever discuss channel creat compartmentalis discussionsher exampl im takingadvantag new project whichi creat differ discussionchannel around particular topicit discuss channel allow lower number email companyin discuss space member send import inform membersthey ask openend question repli question etcth advantag leverag exchang retriev discuss thread timefin want convers peopl outsid channel entir possiblesimpli go chat tab andthen enter one namesher discuss limitedto peopl invitedal need chooseth right tool channel want share inform witha team chat tab want oneonon talk exchang peopl one teamto summaris team allow youto centralis exchangesy automat reduc thenumb messag inboxesand leverag knowledg

Recovering previous Office 365 Groups,"You are already using Office 365 groups, and this approach seems very useful so far. However, you want to limit the number of interfaces for your users, and you would like to use Teams as a central location and main tool for every access. Will you need to give up your existing groups to recreate them as a team in Teams? Will you be losing all of the group’s components? Will your users be able to find their way in Teams, and will they have to adapt to this change? Teams gives you the option of recovering your previous Office 365 groups when you create a team. This is easy to do. When your cursor is positioned on the “Teams” tab, click on “Add team”. Next, click on “Create team”. At the bottom of the screen, use the link “Create a team from an existing Office 365 group”. Teams will suggest a list of groups that are available and that have not yet been transformed into a team in the Teams application.Choose the group that you want and confirm your choice. Your team has been created.The members will be notified by email and will be invited to connect to Teams as part of a new team. The files will also be recovered in the “Files” section of the general channel, and the storage space will remain the same. If your group had a notebook or a plan in Planner, you can also recover it. In the tabs, click on the “+” sign and choose OneNote, for example. Teams will find all the notebooks that you are using. Here is the one that was used in the group. It now appears as a tab.You can do this for different applications, such as Planner, to recover tasks from the previous group. That way, your colleagues will not be affected by this change. They will find exactly the same tools. Only the access will change and will even make their daily tasks easier. With Teams, you can recover your previous Office 365 groups with just a few clicks. Everything will be or can be recovered. And your users or colleagues don’t have to change their habits.",alreadi use offic 365 group approach seem use far howev want limit number interfac user would like use team central locat main tool everi access need give exist group recreat team team lose group compon user abl find way team adapt chang team give option recov previou offic 365 group creat team easi cursor posit team tab click add team next click creat team bottom screen use link creat team exist offic 365 group team suggest list group avail yet transform team team applicationchoos group want confirm choic team createdth member notifi email invit connect team part new team file also recov file section gener channel storag space remain group notebook plan planner also recov tab click sign choos onenot exampl team find notebook use one use group appear tabyou differ applic planner recov task previou group way colleagu affect chang find exactli tool access chang even make daili task easier team recov previou offic 365 group click everyth recov user colleagu dont chang habit
Adding storage spaces in Teams,"Are you using several SharePoint spaces? What if these spaces are not linked to any Office 365 group or team? You are probably wondering how you can use a new tool that would make it possible to centralize all those spaces and make your teams’ daily tasks easier. The solution seems to be Teams, but can you connect the different storage spaces that you have created in SharePoint? When you create a team in Teams, a linked storage space is automatically created. If you want to connect other storage spaces in order to centralise information and to provide your team with all of the tools it needs, it’s very simple. Go to the “General” channel and click on the “+” sign to add a tab. Here, we are going to link a SharePoint site that the team uses to store certain documents. All you need to do is choose a site from the list that Teams is proposing, that is, by specifying the URL for the relevant space.Once your choice has been confirmed, a new tab will be displayed for this SharePoint space. That way, you can link several SharePoint spaces to the channel. It will then be easier for your colleagues to access all the resources they need. All that is required is to use Teams as your main tool so that you no longer have various interfaces spread out here and there.With Teams, you can link SharePoint storage spaces or even many other tools and resources. The advantage is that you don’t have to move or rebuild what already existed.

Sway - Create an interactive panel,"Hello and Welcome to this presentation on Sway. This is your trainer speaking, my name is Antoine. Thank you very much for being here.2Before starting I would like to give you some information about this presentation. So this presentation will be recorded and made available on the MOOC Office 365 platform.3Also in order to have a clear sound your microphones are turned off, so please if you have any questions feel free to ask in the chat. I will take a few minutes at the end of the presentation to answer all your questions.4Let's see the plan of this presentation. About the plan, we will explain in 2 minutes what Sway is. Then we will start our first Sway from the web app. We will see that we can start from a blank Sway or document, a template or even a topic suggested by Sway.5So I will show you all the options available to start your new Sway. After that, we will format it and, once finished, we will share it with our colleagues. So my first question is: What is Sway? What can we do with Sway? I'm going to try to give you a small introduction about it.6Sway is a new app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share interactive reports, personal stories, presentations and more. You will start by adding your own texts and pictures, search for an import relevant content from other sources and then you have to watch Sway do the rest. You will see it's very easy.7You're no longer limited to picking a pre-designed template that makes your presentation looks like everyone else's and you don't have to have any design skills to transform and broadcast information in a modern and interactive way. There's no need either to spend lots of time on formatting.8Its building design engine takes care of making your creation look its best. If the initial design doesn't quite match your test, you can easily apply another one or fully customize your layouts to make it your own. So you will see there are many options for customization.9Once you are done creating your Sway, it's super easy to share it. Your colleagues and partners can see your creations on the Web, signing in or without signing up. , you can change the privacy settings for any Sway whenever you want for more control over what you will share.10I would like also to give you another information before starting to create our first Sway. It's good to know that Sway is free to use for anyone with a Microsoft account but you can create more sophisticated Sways with more content when you use Sway as part of an Office 365 subscription. So to let you know,11you will get more content and you will be able to get more sophisticated Sways. I won't go further about the plan. I will go directly to the application. So let's discover Sway. The first thing you need to know if you want to access Sway,12you need to log in on your Office 365 portal and then you will find the Sway tile in the middle. If you can't find it here, I invite you to click on the Web app launcher on the left corner and then you will find the Sway tile right here.13Let's discover now Sway. You will see in few seconds from the main page I can see all my existing Sways. You can see them in the middle of my page. I will explain to you in details aach tab during this presentation, but to let you know from the Analytics tab,14right here, you can also have statistics on the consultation of my Sways. I can see all the people who saw my Sways and I have some statistics about it. to show you that really quickly, the Deleted tab allows you to restore a Sway that you deleted you have 30 days15to restore a Sway. After that, it's not possible anymore. So remember that if you make a mistake, you delete your Sway, it's OK, you can still restore it from this tab. Let's come back to the first tab. I would like to explain to you a few things about the way to start your Sway.16If you want to start your Sway there are many options. You can start from a blank page: there is a button here Create New. Let me show you that. If we do that, we will have to build our Sway from the beginning. We will have to add everything: pictures, text, we will have to format it, we will have to choose a style,17we will have to do everything from the beginning. So this is the first option available. We will do that in a few minutes. I want to show you the other options before. What you can do also, you can start from a template. It could be good if you have no idea about how to start your Sway.18You have to choose one from that list and then, let me show you that, you can consult the Sway already existing.19If like this one, if you like this template, if you want to use it to create your first Sway click on the button Start editing this Sway. Let me show you that, this will be really easy. I have to edit my card and I will also be able to add pictures and cards.20This is a good way to start your first Sway if you have no idea how to start.21There is also something really useful if you have no idea how to start. You can do it from a topic: there is a button on top Start from a topic and I'm going to give you an example. If I click on it, I will choose a topic, for example dinosaur.22And then I will click on Create outline.23So this is really good to have a solid starting point and then I will be able to continue building the rest of my Sway. As you can see it is still loading. In a few moment, I will see there is there is a lot of information on it, a lot of content. We can see that there is some text, some pictures, etc.24For your information, we are still on the edit mode, it means this is not what your Sway will look like when someone plays it. I will show you in a few moments from the Play button how it looks, .25The last option, we can do, let me show you that: we can start from a document. If for example you already have a PowerPoint document that you want to use to create a presentation, you can do that from this button Start from a document. I'm going to show you that: I will find a document from my computer.26I will load it and then Sway will try to build my Sway with the document I selected. I will have a lot of things to change, but at least I will have a lot of content. I will need to format everything. This is according to the document I loaded.27Then I can customize everything on it.28Just remember that there are 4 options to start your Sway. You can start from a new blank Sway, from a topic, from a template or from a document. Let's start our first way from a new blank page.29So I will use the first button Create New.30We are by default on the Storyline tab. There are two tabs: Design and Storyline. Let me explain to you the first tab Storyline. The storyline is where you type insert, edit and format the content that tells your story.31Content is arranged in sequential order by adding cards containing the type of content you want, such as text, images, videos and even Ofice documents. The order of cards can be rearranged at anytime to switch your needs.32We can start by giving a name to our Sway and choosing an image. So I click on Title your Sway shown in the first card on the storyline.33So we have to choose a title. Type a short but meaningful description of what your Sway is about. When you later share your finished Sway, this title will be the first thing others will see, so it is really important to choose a meaningful description.34Now let's add a photo. I can add a photo by clicking on the background button but you can also use the drag and drop in Sway. So we could drag a picture and it should also work. When I click on this button, I can load a picture from my device,35from my computer, from my OneDrive, but also from the web. If I have no pictures about dinosaurs, for example, I will type Dinosaur36in the Search field and I should be able to load any photo from the web for example, this one. I'm going to add this picture. About pictures, I have a few things to explain to you. Whenever you add pictures, Sway tries to identify thins like faces,37horizons and other strong lines. Sway then considers all of these elements work together and where the picture is being used. You have to understand that. How much of the inserted image will be shown and which parts may be cropped further depends on the constraints of your current devices as well as38the applied layout and style. So I'm going to give you a trick about it. You can easily mark the most important parts of an inserted picture to make sure that those parts are always shown in your Sway. Do the following: click on the Focus Points button.39If you want to add focus points to the part of the picture you always want shown in your Sway, click on these areas in the selected picture.40You can add as many focus points as you want. To change any existing focus points, drag it to the new location you want. We can change the location when we drag it. To delete it click again on it and that's it.41If you want to always show the entire picture in your Sway, select this box The entire image is important. If you want to reset the picture to its original state, click on the Reset button.42In my example, I would like to see the entire image. So I tick the box The entire image is important. I can close this window.43If we want to add more content to a Sway, such as text, images or videos, we need to click on the tab or tap the plus icon at the bottom of any existing card. As I said, we can also use the drag and drop if we want to drag and drop any text or image.44Don't hesitate to experiment: you can change the order of your content at anytime and customize each card the way you want.45As you can see, there are many options on it. For example, if we added a card with text, we can use the formatting toolbar. I just need to write something on it, and then if I need I can use the formatting toolbar on top.46If you want to insert more content and you don't find everything you want from the plus button, there is also the possibility to use the Insert button from the ribbon Insert content in your Sway.47Select your preferred content source from the menu. As you can see, we can select videos for example, and then we will type the name of the  video we are looking for in the Search field. My theme is a dinosaur so I will stay on with dinosaurs and I will add for example, a short video.48This one, for example. I will validate by clicking on the Add button.49As you can see, there are many possibilities, we can add many contents. I could keep going on like that for 30 minutes, but this is not the point of this presentation. Now we have the basics to start your first Sway. You understood that we can start from a new page, from a document50from a template or from a suggested topic, and then from any Sway, from the storyline tab, you can customize the content of any card and you can add several cards by clicking on the plus icon.51I just repeat that, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the chat. I will have a look at the end of the presentation and I will take a few minutes to answer your questions.52Now let's see how we can change the style of our Sway. We said before Sway takes care of the formatting, design and layout of your content. You can keep it or you can select and apply your own and even customize layouts if you need it.53To choose a style for your Sway, we need to switch to the Design tab. I will click on style from the ribbon on the right side column.54If you want to control how others will view and navigate your Sway once you have shared it, select whether your content should scroll vertically, horizontally or appear like a presentation. So there are 3 options here.55Just to show you the differences: horizontal,56vertical,57and if you prefer like a presentation, like slides.58There is also another trick I would like to give you, this is not an obligation to use it. But if you have no idea about the style you want for your Sway, you can also use the Remix! button on top59to choose a random look. If you click on it,60I'll see another kind of styles I can apply if I need it. If I keep clicking on it, I will see different styles. If you have no idea click on the Remix! button, this is really helpful.61You can also adjust specific parts of the currently applied style, such as the colour, the font and the textures by clicking on the Customize button. Click on it and you can change the colors,62the font, we can change many things from that tab. Just remember that, w can go further: for example, you can also change the text size. For example, I would like to have a bigger text. In the example the text is bigger.63I can make it smaller. So remember that, you can go really far with the styles and the customization of your Sway.64Now we created and customized our Sway, we are ready to share it. But before I would like to have an overview, a preview of my Sway. You can do it from any tab, from the Design tab and also from the Storyline tab. There is a Play button on top.65If you click on it, you will see how your Sway looks.66 67If you need to edit it, there is a button on top. You can also share it from here or you can click on the 3 dots to duplicate this Sway or save it as a template. It could be great, if you created an amazing Sway you can save it and you will be able to use it for another Sway or you can also share it with someone else.68You can share a Sway for co-edition but also for consultation and your coworkers could use it to create their own Sways if they need it .69Now we are ready to share it. I click on the Share button on top and I would like to explain this window to you. In your Sway, there are 3 available permission levels: specific people or groups, those in your organization with the link and70anyone with the link. By default, those in your organization with the link security settings is preselected for you. No one will be able to find your Sway unless you send them the link. But these different permission levels can make the Sway even more secure is it contains sensitive information.71Let me give you more details about the 3 options. Specific people or groups, the first one: Only people or groups within your organization for who you explicitly granted permission will be able to view or edit your Sway. When you send a view or edit link to72specific people, they will be required to sign in so they can see your Sway. This is the most secure setting so use this option for sensitive or confidential information that you don't want to share publicly.73The second one, those in your organization with the link: Only people at your work will be able to view or edit your Sway and they also need to sign in to be able to see it. Be sure to use this option for sensitive or confidential information that74only people in organization should see. Because, be careful, if we are working in the same company, if I share a Sway with Mark, he can forward my link to Leah and Leah is also working in my company so she will be able to see my Sway. This is not possible with the first possibility Specific people or groups.75This is the big difference. Be careful, the coworker with whom you share your Sway can forward the link to someone else in the company and this other person will be able to see your Sway, so be careful. Finally if you choose Anyone with a link, only people who have been given76the link to your Sway will be able to view or edit it. Be careful, this is the same thing: this link can be forwarded to someone else, even someone external to a company. This is not secured like the first one. Remember these few options.77Then we also have to decide if our colleague can only view my Sway or if they can also edit it. There are two buttons: Invite people to view it or to edit it. View it like only consultation, they can't modify anything on it. Edit it, they will be able to build your Sway,78to delete some cards you already added, etc. Once you are ready, you can get your visual link and share it with who you want. There is a button Get visual link. Click on it and then click on the Copy button. You can then pass this link into a Skype conversation,79an email, whatever you want.80I made an overview of all these possibilities. I would like to make a small conclusion before answering to your questions. To conclude this presentation, remember Sway allows you to create your professional looking,81interactive presentations, newsletters, tutorials and you don't have to have any design skills to transform and broadcast your Sway.82Sway works in all modern mobile browsers, regardless of platform, and is always just a tap away. You can also download freely the Sway mobile app to use it even on the go. You will find it in any market, iPhone, Android, etc.83I will have a look at your questions and I will try to give you an answer. Thank you everyone for your presence and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the chat.84Laurence, I saw your questions. Yes, you can start from any PPT or Word documents. With Publisher, it's not allowed yet. But as I said, It's a new application. You can give your feedbacks, if there are many people who want that I'm pretty sure they will make an update to add this possibility.85For now, you can start from a PowerPoint or Word document.86I'm going to come back on the first page, Start from a document and as I said, I can use any Excel document. I made it with the PowerPoint documents but I can do it with a Word document.87Yes, Laurence, even if you shared your Sway with someone else and for example, you picked only for specific people, you can switch to another permission level whenever you want according to your needs. You can change that, there is no problem at all.88From the main page, I would like to show you something quickly. I guess my coworkers stopped the sharing. I had one Sway shared on my screen here and I could see that there is an icon to see how many people saw this Sway.89If it's my own Sway, I will be able to enter it and to change any sharing options, but don't worry Laurence, it's possible.90If you need to watch another tutorial video, to go further about it I invite you to consult the MOOC Office 365 platform and also from the application, there is a button Tutorials: You can watch videos about Sway.

PowerApps - Creating an application for your field agents in just a few minutes,"Your company’s main activity is based on interventions in the homes of your customers. Each time that your field agents intervene, they need to fill out an intervention sheet and then retype the data in an Excel file that you shared with them. This double data entry is a waste of time and money for your company. Your agents are asking for a solution so that it will be easier for them to enter data and especially so that they don’t have to enter it twice. How can you make data entry easier during interventions? Is it practical and quick to use the Excel mobile version to enter the data directly in the shared file? How much time will it takeand what will it cost to order an application that would facilitate data entry for your workers? Microsoft PowerApps can help you. In just a few minutes, it can produce a professional application with no particular knowledge in programming required. In my example, I’m going to build an application for data entry in forms that will automatically fill in my Excel file.On the PowerApps home page, you have several options. You can start the application creation from scratch, from data, and from existing templates. In my case, I want to start from an Excel chart. So I’ll choose the option “from data”.The advantage of this option is that PowerApps will generate a complete and functional application for me in a few seconds. It will consider that my column headings are fields where you can enter data in the application. Before generating this application, I can check here to see what it will look like.I’m going to choose “Make this app” to start, and then the space where my data will be stored. I choose the file in question and then the data table. Finally, I log in to start creating the application. By default, the application generates three screens. The first one allows you to browse all the items. You will then find a screen to display the details of an item, and a screen to add and edit items. My application is ready to be used. To see how it works, I use this button at the top right of the interface.This suits me. I can now share this application with my agents, or I can begin to customize it. I can change the theme of the application, the labels and the items to be displayed here.By clicking on the data source, I have the option of aligning the items, changing the layout, sorting the items and removing some of them. To make data entry easier for my agents, it is better to change the items “Agent_name” and “Intervention_type” in the drop-down list of predetermined choices.This is quite simple. I will choose the type next to the name of the item and then “Allowed Values”. Next, in the Advanced section, I fill in the choices in the Items field by using this writing style. My application is now ready to be shared. To do so, I go to the File menu, I give it a name, I choose an icon and I save my work.I can then select Share this app to make it available to my agents. Here, I have two options: I can fill in the names of the agents one at a time, or I can make the application available to everyone in my organization. My agents can also use the application. As soon as they enter information in the application, it will automatically be entered in my Excel file. With PowerApps, creating mobile applications has never been so easy. PowerApps is designed to promote mobility and make field work easier. Using PowerApps helps you to save you a lot of time and money.",compani main activ base intervent home custom time field agent interven need fill intervent sheet retyp data excel file share doubl data entri wast time money compani agent ask solut easier enter data especi dont enter twice make data entri easier intervent practic quick use excel mobil version enter data directli share file much time takeand cost order applic would facilit data entri worker microsoft powerapp help minut produc profession applic particular knowledg program requir exampl im go build applic data entri form automat fill excel fileon powerapp home page sever option start applic creation scratch data exist templat case want start excel chart ill choos option datath advantag option powerapp gener complet function applic second consid column head field enter data applic gener applic check see look likeim go choos make app start space data store choos file question data tabl final log start creat applic default applic gener three screen first one allow brows item find screen display detail item screen add edit item applic readi use see work use button top right interfacethi suit share applic agent begin custom chang theme applic label item display herebi click data sourc option align item chang layout sort item remov make data entri easier agent better chang item agent_nam intervention_typ dropdown list predetermin choicesthi quit simpl choos type next name item allow valu next advanc section fill choic item field use write style applic readi share go file menu give name choos icon save worki select share app make avail agent two option fill name agent one time make applic avail everyon organ agent also use applic soon enter inform applic automat enter excel file powerapp creat mobil applic never easi powerapp design promot mobil make field work easier use powerapp help save lot time money
Teams - Collaborate as a team,"Hello everyone.Welcome to this online session called Collaborate with your Team in Teams.My name is Thomas and I will be giving this presentation today.Before I start and in order to ensure it runs smoothly,it's important that you listen to the following instructions carefully.There are precisely three little instructions.The first one is: during this presentation, please do not take waiting calls or second calls.The music on hold will start playing and we'll no longer be able to hear one another.The second one: is on your end, please turn the microphone offby switching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know,some of you may be are working in open space environments,so those are just cautionary measuresto avoid unpredictable or unwanted background noise.The third and last one is:remember to keep your computer screen active at all timesby wheeling the mouse every now and then.It's very important that you do not let your computer go into sleep modeas this would cause the interruption of the videoand you'd find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience is that you will have to repeat the login stepsall over again to get back in it.This is going to be a 45-minute session and our objectives areto experience the collaborative work with one simple and efficient tool.Then go to the MOOC platform to further your training.Before I jump to the outline of this presentation,I just want to stress that Microsoft Teams is a neat applicationthat allows you to create teams to achieve tasks.The tasks themselves can be broken down into subtasks,which is very useful if you are using project management software.You can allocate team members to each of these subtasksand the software allows you to provide the resources for the team memberssuch as documents, files, web links and so on.And for each task or subtask,the software is included in Microsoft Office 365 and is simply called Teams.To start it, of course, you will need to log onto your Microsoft Office portal and select Teams.Once opened, you can either work on it online or download it for offline working.Today's plan is to see how to create a team, to manage the team's files,to use the team's notebook, to organise and schedule meetingsand there will be a little Q and A at the end of this training session.And, of course, we'll see the rest of the study plan.Let's begin right now.I'm going to put Teams on the screen.First of all, we already saw on the Communicate with Teams training sessionhow to create a team.We are going to go back quickly on it just as a little reminder.Of course, I'm on my Teams.On the left, I have all of the different tabs.Just after it, I have all of my different teamsand, on the right, I have the viewing window.On the bottom left, I can join or create a team.Of course we find back the ability to create a team or to join a team with a code.Let's create one.I will build it from scratch.I will set it to private and then, for the name, I will just call it:Collaborate with Teams.Let's create it.Once again is going to take a few secondsand I will have to choose the different members of this team.Let's add some of them quickly.Apparently some of them don't want to be added.Let's go just with Oliver.Right here, we have our team with the first channel that's automatically created,as you can see on the left, the General channel.What do we want to see on Teams?Let's go on the different tabs directing to the channel.The first one is Conversation,we already saw that on the other training session.But we have Files.Let's click on Files.As you can see, right now is still setting up the file directory.Just after you created a new team,it will take a few minutes to set up everything in it.We are not going to wait for it to set it up the file directory.Let's just go on Alpha Project, right here in the General channel.The files tab once again.Wait a few seconds for it to load.And as you can see, we have no files in it.So we will see what we can do with it.On the top, we have different options.The first one, we have New, to create a new document.After it, we have Upload, to upload documents from my computer to Teams.Get a link, to share everything.Add a Cloud storage and Open SharePoint.So we are going to see each of them individually.Let's begin with New.In New, I can create a new folder, a new document, Word, Excel, PowerPoint.First of all, let's create a folder.Let's just call it: Test Folder 01.It would take a few seconds for it to appear on the screen because it's being created.As you can see, we have Test Folder 01 on the screen.Once again, you click on New, then Word document.Let's just call it Word 01.As you can see, there is no Word application or software that's open.It's just Word Online directly into Teams.I do not have to download anything to go online or whatever,I can access Word, Excel, PowerPoint directly in Teams.So right here, of course, I can add different information.As you can see, I had different information in it.And when it's done, as you can see, on the top, we have Saving.Automatically Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. are going to save everythingthat I had directly into the account that I just created.On the top right, I can start the conversation within this documentor I can close it.Let's start a conversation to see what it looks like.And on the right, a conversation panel just opened and I can add replies.So now it's a conversation feed and, of course,with all of the different participants in this Word document,because we can edit the document at the same time with the synchronisation.So everyone in the document will be able to see the conversationon the right and answer to it, but also we're going to see just after,we're going to see it directly into the conversation feed of the conversation tab.So let's close it.So we have the Test Folder and we have Word 01 right here.Let's continue.After it, I have Upload.I click on Upload, it will take a few seconds to open,and I have, as you can see, all of my files right here from my computerand I can click on one to add it into Teams.Get a link, we have a link from Teams or from the SharePoint,I can share both of them.And if I send them to someone who have access to the Teamsor if you set public Teams, let's say,they will be able to arrive directly into this file libraryand then they will be able to access the documents.Add a Cloud storage.On the Cloud storage I can add a SharePoint, a Dropbox,a Box, a ShareFile and a Google Drive.All of them, we are able to access them like SharePoint, as you can see here,and add a document in it.And open SharePoint, as you may have guessed,if I click on it, it will open SharePoint directly into the file library of the SharePoint,which is linked to the file library of the Teams, of course.Let's check one of the documents.I checked the Word document.As you can see, I have new options right here.First of all, I have Open.I can open it in Teams, open it in Word Onlineor open it in the Word software installed on my computer.I can get a link to share it.I can make it a tab, we'll see this just after.I can download it, of course, I can delete it, move it, copy it, rename itand I can open SharePoint to have the SharePoint file library once again.So let's make it a tab.As you can see on the top, I know I have Word 01 as a tab.If I click elsewhere, so I'm back in the file,and now I click on Word, it will be the Word document.And so, I will be able, on the top right, to edit it in Teams in Word Online.And of course, once again,all of the members of this Teams will be able to edit it whenever they want.And they're free to download it or open it in SharePoint.Let's go back to the conversation feed.On the bottom, we have the Word 01 documentand with it, I have the replies that I added just beforewhen I was in the conversation feed on the right.Right here, as you can see, I have ""Hello all"" that I added just before.It's possible, within the conversation tab and within the Files tab,to reply to each other, one being on the file, the other being directlyinto Teams into the conversation feed of the Alpha project team.So you'll be able to collaborate quickly directly on it.After it, we're going to talk about…Let's add a new tab.We are going to talk about OneNote, OneNote directly into Teams.I have to wait a bit for it to load.And as you can see right here,I can either choose an existing OneNote to add it directly into Teamsor I can create a new one.Let's create a new one and let's call it Alpha Project 01.And let's save it.Now it's setting up the OneNote tab so it will take a few seconds once again.We have right here: This notebook is empty. Click here to create a new section.I click it.I can enter a section name.Let's name it, for example, Meetings.I have my Meetings section.If I click on the little arrow,I can see right here Meetings on the Meetings sectionand I can create new pages in it.So let's say: ""Meeting from January"".If I click back on the little arrow, I have here Meeting from January.And I can add a page, Meeting from December, for example.So as you can see, on the little OneNote, I will be able to add different sections.So let's create one called Marketing.And here I will have the Meetings section, the Marketing sectionand, in each of them, I will have different pages.I can quickly organise my different notes being from important meetings,being just some little information, etc.Directly into the OneNote page, what can I do?Let's open the little tab on the top, and pin them.As you can see in the right, I can pin it to just have it on the top.I can write whenever and wherever I want.As you can see, we do not have any lines or margins …we just have the ability to write wherever we want.Of course, if I want to, I can edit the text, put it in bold,change the font, the size of the font,the colourand also I can add different, as you can see, bullets or numbering to do little lists.We have the same styles of possibilities as you can have on Word.But the most important thing right here is little tags.The tags, we have a lot of them.Some of them are just little icons.For example, Idea, right here, it’s just an icon.But if I put for example, To Do, let's just write ""Test"" again and again,I can check the one that are doneand leave unchecked the ones that I haven't done yet.So it's little to-do list to remember what you have to do.And we have the same thing on the bottom, as you can see,Discuss with, Discuss with, Schedule, Call back,To Do priority 1, priority 2, and Client request.But you can use them as you want, there is no mandatory usage for it.But as you can see, I can add little icons wherever I want.After it, I have the dictate option.If I want to, I can select, for example, let's say English US,and when it will be launched, activated,everything that I will be saying will be directly dictated by OneNote.So let's click on it.And now that the dictation is activated,everything that I'm saying out loud will be written directly into OneNote.I don't have to touch my keyboard or my mouse,I just have to talk out loud and then everything will be written directly on it.It would make you gain time, of course,but as you must have guessed, it may have some problems in it,maybe it didn't understand correctly what you said,so you'd have to check what you said and what is written, of course.We have the little text right here.I can now click on Insert.In insert, I can insert new pages, but also new sections.We already saw that.But I can also add little tables.The same table as we had on Word for example,and now I have a little table right here and I can add little information in it.It's just a simple table, nothing more.I can add pictures from my computer.I can use the camera button if I have a webcam, if I have my smartphone or my tablet.But I can also use the online picture functionality.Let's click on it,and here I have default searches.But I can also search for my own topic.Let's say, for example turtles,and I will find little images of turtles.I click on one, I click on Insert,and, of course, the little picture will be added directly into the OneNote.I can also do files print out.What is this?If I click on it, I have to select a Word or PDF document.Let's check if we have one of them.Unfortunately, I don't have a document that I can use for this presentation,but what it will do, it just prints the document on the screen.You won't be able to edit this document.You won't be able to add different information on it.It will be like a picture of the document on your OneNote, a printout.I can also attach files.I click on it, let's add the Admin Guide for example.I insert it,and in OneNote, I will have in a few seconds a little file on the OneNote,and by clicking on this file, everybody will be able to download it and open it.Like we used to do on email, we can do it on OneNote.And at any given moment, I can delete it.I have, of course, Add-in, I can add links.I can record the audio.Let's say, we are in a meeting,we want to record the audio around us, we click on it.I can add different symbols, why not emojis and stickers.After it, we have the draw tab.In the draw tab, I can use the pen tool to do just little drawings.I also have a highlighter to highlight the different important informationthat I have into my OneNote and, of course, in different colours,as you can see right here.Then lastly, we have a View tab for sub settings that we can use right here.Then we have Open in OneNote.As you may have guessed once again,is to open this document directly into OneNote software.We saw everything that we had to see about OneNote.Now we can talk about the meetings.So let's go back on the conversation tab, the meetings.Let's click on the Calendar tab on the left.On the calendar tab…Apparently Teams did not like me opening the calendar tab, so we will open it again.It would take a few seconds for Teams to open, as you can see it's searching up right here.The joy of the computer,sometimes the applications don't want to work properly,but you just close.As you can see, we are back on it.Let's wait for it to load for a second and then we go back into the training session.We are back on the calendar taband here we have our different meetings right here.As you can see, it's for Today on the top.I find my different meetingsand, if I want to, I'll be able to change events.As you can see, I have the agenda view right here.And I'm able to find all of the different meetings that I will have today, tomorrow, Wednesday, etc.On the right, I can accept a meeting to say: I will be here.I can use the Tentative button – ""maybe I will be here, maybe not, I'm not sure"" –or I can decline it – ""I won't be here"".If we go back on the Teams right here, the Teams tab,in the conversation feed once again, on the bottom,I will be able to use the Meet now button.I can add subjects to create what we call an instant meeting.An instant meeting, to be quick on it, let's say: ""Important Alpha Project""and I can click on Meet now.If I click on Meet now,I will begin an instant meeting with everybody in this team.So everybody in the Teams,and you will see in a few seconds right here, everybody on this team will see thisand they will be able to click on Join to join directly this instant meeting.But they won't get any notification or whatever, but it's only if they are on Teams.So we are going to talk about the meetings, what can we do during a meeting a bit later.Let's close it.Let's click on it once again,and here, instead of adding subjects or meeting now,we have on the bottom, as you can see, Camera.So if I had a camera, I will be able to turn it on or turn it off.Just if I want people to see me or not.Of course, when you create a meeting, you will have to choose the right channel for it.As we said on the Communicate with Teams training session,everybody in the Teams will have accessto the contents of all the different channels in it.So if you want to create a meeting in the Marketing channel right here,everybody also in the General channel and members of the Teams will be able to access these meetings.So be very careful about that.Let's launch our instant meeting.What can we do during a meeting or an instant meeting?Of course, I can turn on or turn off my camera or my microphone.But I will have the little sharing tray on the bottom.On the sharing tray, I will be able to share my desktop,my Screen 1, as you can see, or Screen 2, if I have different screens.I will be able to share also a window.So on the window, as you can see,I have all the different applications that are open.I can click on one to share it.And I can also share a PowerPoint.Lastly, on the right, I will be able to use the whiteboard.We have two different whiteboards, the Microsoft one and the Freehand one.Everything in it…And we'll talk a bit more about thatin the training session about the Teams meetings.We have a 45-minute training session about that,so we go into depth about all of this.Here is just a general presentation.On the top right, I will have the ability to take notes, to resume it quickly.I click on Take Notes.Let's wait for it to load for a few seconds.And right here, we have Notes, so I can give it a name.Let's call it: ""Meeting notes"".And here, I can add information, just write whatever.But as you can see, I can add information and I can edit the text,but also add pictures or tables if needed.After it, I can show a conversation because, as we did in the Files tab,the conversations on the right, I can do the exact same here.I can have a little conversation on the right with … that depends on the meeting.But this conversation will appear into the conversation feed of the channel.So be careful if you add sensitive information in it,everybody in the Teams will be able to access it and to view it.Then we can add people in the meeting.We see everybody in the meeting – currently only Amaury.The suggestions are the people in this team and I can invite people in here.But also, I can copy as they join and for to send them to some people.Then the setting panels to change your devices;speakers, microphone and the camera, if I want one.So I can turn on or turn off the private viewingthat allows the participants to move through shared presentation on their own.I have to change here if I want to.We quickly saw little things about the Meetings possibilities in Teams.Lastly, on the left we have the Files tab, on the far left.In the Files tab, I will find all of my recent files,I will find all of the files that are in different Teams,so let's wait for it for a second.So right here, we have, as you can see, the little files once againand, on the right, I have the locations.The files that are downloaded recently,and I can add different Cloud storage, OneDrive,but also I can Box, Dropbox, etc., as we saw before.And we will find them back in here in the Cloud storage.The three little dots are for different applications.What are those applications?If you go on the Teams and you want to add a new tab,right here we will find all of the different applicationsthat we have access to  – and we have a lot of them, of course.Let's go back on our PowerPoint slide.So what did we see today?To begin with, we can join or create a team,as we saw in the Communicate training session.I can manage the team files by going into the Teams.In the different channels, I will have Files.And in Files, I will find different files that I can use.For the Teams notebook,I will find little notebooks that all of the coworkers have access toand will be able to edit it.To organise and schedule meetingswe have a little button, on the bottom left into the Meetings' tab,Schedule a meeting with your staff.We didn't see it today before.As I said, we have a training session specifically about that,so we'll talk more about that in it.And, of course, we saw the different informationfor the future meetings, if we accept, tentative or decline.If you have any question, do not hesitate.I'm here to answer them all.If you do not have any questions,because this presentation has come to an end,I would push it to the part where I'll show you how the MOOC platform works.I will use my personal account and dashboard on it for now,because you already all know about this digital platform.We already saw it a few times.Just remember the little calendar that you can use on the topto find all of the different training sessions to comeand also different tabs.There's the number of courses you're taking, the learning courses,training sessions and, of course, number of shares.And do not forget about, as you can see right here,Most Consulted, Recommended for you, and Most Recent.All of those training sessions that are into your dashboard,you will find them directly in it.And for the Recommended for you, the more you follow training sessions,the more the algorithm for it will be interestingand so you will find

Teams - Communicate as a team,"Hello everyone.Welcome to this online session called Communicate with Your Team in Teams.My name is Thomas and I will be giving this presentation today.Before I start, and in order to ensure that it runs smoothly,it's important that you listen to the following instruction carefully.There are precisely three of them.The first one: During this presentation, please do not take a call waiting or a second call.The music on hold will start playing and we no longer be able to hear one another.The second one is: On your end, please turn the microphone offby switching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know, some of you may be working in open space environments,so those are just cautionary measures to avoid unpredictable or unwanted background noise.The third and last one is: Remember to keep your computer screen activeat all time by wheeling the mouse every now and then.It is very important you do not let your computer go into sleep modeas this will cause interruption of the videoand you will find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience here is that you will have to repeatthe log in step all over again to get back in.So this is going to be a 45-minute session and our objectives areto experience the collaborative work with one simple and efficient tool.Then go to the MOOC platform to further your training.But before I jump into the outline of this presentation,I just want to stress that Microsoft Teams is a neat application thatallows you to create teams to achieve tasks.The tasks themselves can be broken down into subtasks,which is very useful if you are using project management software.You can allocate team members to each of the subtasksand the software allows you to provide resources for the team memberssuch as documents, files, web links and so on.And for each task or subtask, this software is includedin Microsoft Office 365 and is simply called Teams.To get started, of course, you would need to log onto your Microsoft Office portal and select Teams.Once opened, you can either work it online or download it for offline working.So today's plan is to see how to, first of all, create a team or to add a channel,how to manage your own profile, how to follow your team activity,how to use the instant messaging.And after that, we will also go over the most important things to remember.I can then answer any question you may haveat the very end with the rest of the study plan as well.So let's put Teams directly on the screen.So we are here on Teams.To begin with, we have on the left the different tabs available to do different things.Then we have our different teams.We have the channels just under it.And on the right, we have the viewing window.What do we want to do to begin with?Well, we want to create a team.I want my colleagues to be in specific teams to do specific tasks.So on the bottom left, let's click on Join or create a team.We have many more possibilities right here.First of all, we have Create a team.That's what we want to do right here.But let's wait a few seconds before going into it.Then we have Join a team with a code.Well, when you are part of a team, you can, if you want, generate a code.This code, you can send it to anyone,and this person right here would be able to enter the code,click in Join team, and he will join your team as a guest.He will be able to see everything, but it will be only a guest.Then for Alpha and for MOOC Microsoft 365 right here,we have what we call public teams.Those public teams, everybody in the company is able to join them.But of course, they just have to go in here, click on Join teamand there will be a member of your team.Let's click on Create a team.We have two possibilities right here.First of all, Build a team from scratch.We just want to create our own team from the base.But we also have Create from an existing Office 365 group or team.You may already know this, but when you create a SharePoint,automatically, you will create an Outlook group, but also a planner, for example.Same thing for the Outlook group.You create it, you create a SharePoint, you create a planner, etc.When you create a team, you will create SharePoint,an Outlook group and a planner.So let's say, you already have a SharePoint called Communication.If you create a new team, also called a Communication,well, you will have two SharePoints.Each of them named Communication.But if you want to link those, both the SharePoint and the team,well, you can create as a team from an existing Office 365 group,and you will link it automatically to the SharePoint that you want.And so, they will share documents, etc.,and you won't have multiple occurrences of the same SharePoint, etc.So let's build a team from scratch.We can set it to private or public.Let's click on Private.Let's give it a name.We'll just call it Teams Communicate.Then I can add a little description:This Team is only for communication purposes.Let's click on Create.It could take a few seconds to create a team.As you can see, it's a thing I did, a nice work of creating it,and then I can add people in it.Let's add for example Oliver, maybe also Lisa and Pierre.I click on Add and, as you can see, that is added.On the right, I have Members.We have a little arrow pointing to the bottom.If I click on it, I can select if each of its members are well members or owners.What's the difference?Well, by creating a team, I am its owner.And I can have multiple owners for a team,which means that Pierre, for example, if I put him as an owner, will be able to changeall of the different settings as well into the teams like if he was the creator of it.And of course, I can add multiple members.But if I put them as only members and not owners,they will only be able to see the commands, to edit them, etc.,but they wouldn't be able to, for example, delete a team.Let's click on Close,and automatically I'm on my team page, Teams Communicate, in the first channel.This channel is named General.What is the difference between a team and a channel?When you create a team, you add members in it.So you'll have, let's say, 10 members.When you create a channel, it's just, let's say, another room for your members to go into.So we'll have General, Marketing, Accounting, etc.Every member in a team is able to access all of the different channels,which means, let's say, you are on Teams Communicate right here.You have, as I said, the Marketing channel and the Accounting channel.Everybody from Accounting will be able to go to Marketingand everybody in Marketing to Accounting.You can't close off certain channel to certain people.It's either everybody can access all of the channels or nobody can access them.So it's mandatory to have all of the different members in all of the different channels.So be careful if you have important or sensitive documents in a channel,everybody in this team is able to access them.If I click on the three little dots on the right of Teams Communicate, right here,I can remove it from my Favourites.As you can see, it's the Favourites folder right here,and, under it, I have More, for all the different teams,I can remove it if you go directly to More.I can manage it, we'll do it later.Add a channel.I click on it.I select a channel, let's say, Marketing.A little description if I want,and I can automatically favourite this channel for the whole team.What does it mean?For the whole team, this channel will appear on the left, right here,just under General, but on top of everything else.And every time I add a channel to the favourites,it will go, let's say we have General and Marketing and Accounting, etc.,so it will go on top every time, but every time under General.General will always be the top one.Let's click on Add.I have Marketing on our channel.Let's go back to the three little dots.I can add members, I can leave the team, but be careful.I can only leave the team if I'm not the only owner.If I'm the only owner, I won't be able to leave it,because every team needs an owner.I can edit it.So if I click on it, I can choose the team name, description or privacy.I can get a link to share it and, of course, I can delete it.If I manage it, let's go see it quickly.I am able to see the different owners, members and guests.And as an owner, I can see that Oliver is no longer an owner,because I am the creator of the team.Oliver, as an owner, wasn't able to say that I am only a member, because I created this team.I can see the pending request if someone wants to join the team,the different channels existing, and I can also add some on top right,and see the different deleted channels that I have.I can go into Settings.We are not going to see everything in Settingsbecause, as you can see, we have a lot of possibilities, but some important things.Let's say, Team code, to generate a team code, of course,and also the Guest permissions.Are they allowed to create or update channels?And are they allowed to delete channels?Then we have Apps, to see the different applications that I can addand, we'll see this later, on the different tabs in the different channels.So now let's go into a channel, General channel.What do we have here?To begin with, we have, on the bottom, right here, the ability to start a conversation.What can I do more?Well, first of all, I can change the format.Put it in bold, italic, underline it, change the colours,add bulleted lists or even numbered lists, quote, link and even snip it.Well, after it, I can also attach files.If I click on it, oh no, as you can see, it was setting it up.I can choose from my recent files.I can browse my teams and channelsto add files from different teams, different channels.I can access the team by OneDriveand also I can directly upload it from my computer.Then I can add emojis, of course, little gifs – those are the little videos that repeat themselves and we have a sort of humour to it.And if you want to consult something, let’s say Marketing,we will have gifs related to marketing.We have little stickers.So once again, little fun things to add.Then we have the Meet now possibility.The Meet now options, we are not going to see them here,because we have a specific training session dedicated to it.So we're not going to talk about it here.Then we have Places, to add different locations to the team,and the three little dots to use some applications.Then we have the conversation feed right hereand, at the top, we have different tabs; Conversion, Files and Wiki.We are going to go back on it in a few seconds.Let's check some settings into the channels.Let's say, Marketing.The three little dots, I can remove it from my favourites.I can get an email address, which means that I can send emailsto this email address and my mail will be readable directly from the conversation feed.I can get a link to the channel to share it, I can edit it,change the names, description of the favourites.I can add some connectors and even delete it, of course.And I can follow it.What does it mean?What's the difference between Favourite and Following?When you put a team in favourite, this channel or this team will be on top,which means that it would be an easy and quick access.But if I follow it, it may not be an easy and quick accessbecause it may not be in favourites, but we will receive notifications.Someone posting a message, someone answers a message,someone likes a message or someone adds files,I will receive notifications.So I will always be able to say if there are new things or not on the team.So Favourite is a quick access, Following is to have notificationsabout everything that is happening on the team right now.So now we're going to talk about the different tab on the top.Conversation, I think it's quite easy: it's a conversation feed.Files,right here you're going to find all of the different files that we can add to our teams.We are not going to talk about the Files tab here becausethe training session Collaborate with Teams talks about it a lot more, a lot further.Then we have the Wiki.The Wiki is like a little notebook, directly integrated to the team.So let's wait for a little bit to load.I can add a page name, so we will just call it Page Test 01.Then I can add sections, Section 01, once again.And then I can add pages.So I can add information right here.Then I click on the little plus to add a new section,Section 02, and once again I can add information.I can edit the format, of course, change the paragraphs,even add images or tables.So while it's a little and quick notebook, not as good as OneNote,but for some little information, it's quite good.So after it, we have, as you can see, the little plus button.The plus button, we have, as you can see, a lot of applications right here.Some of them are well-known: Excel, OneNote, PDF.We have a SharePoint, PowerPoint…We know all of them.But we also have a lot more applications.All of them are directly integrated to Teams.And so, I can click on Trello and I can add Trello to my Teams.For now, let's just do it with, let's say for example, a Planner.Let's click on Planner.So we have to wait for a little bit to load, of course.And here, I can easily create a new plan, a new planner,or I can use an existing planner.Once again, I don't want to have the planner that is named Marketingand then create a new one Marketing on Teams to have two marketing planners.It's useless.So I can use an existing plan for this.Let's create a new one.Let's name it, well, Marketing, of course, because we don't have one for now.I have a check of all box right here posted to the channel about this tab.If I leave it checked, in the conversation feed,there will be a conversation about this tab being added.I can check it.Well, sorry, there will be no conversation about it.Let's save it.While we're waiting for it to load, let's go back quickly into the conversation taband, as you can see, that conversation has begun.We have the little Planner logo right here and Marketing here.By clicking on it, I will access the planner right here.As on any other planner, I have the same possibilities.I can add tasks, assign the tasks to members, set a due dateand, of course, add information and pictures, etc.It’s a planner like the online planner that we all know,but it's directly integrated into Teams.You won't have to open different applications,different software, different web pages, no,you just need Teams to do everything that you wantwith your colleagues, with your co-workers.Let's see what we can add more on it.Plus button once again.I can add a SharePoint.Let's wait for it once again.I can either use an existing SharePoint.For now we have no list.So the SharePoint is linked directly, when I created the Teams.And so, if I add the different pages, different lists to the SharePoint,I will find them back right here by clicking on SharePoint.Let's click on News, for example, let's save it.And the News compartment from our SharePoint, there is nothing herebut you guessed it, if there was something, we would find it.But the pages from a SharePoint, I can add it directly into the Teams once again.As you may have guessed, we can add a lot of different tabs,a lot of different applications directly into Teams.And also, just a little reminder, three little dots, we have the Connectors.Let's see those Connectors quickly.In the Connectors, I have Forms, Azure, RSS, Twitter,Trello, Yammer, etc.What are the Connectors?Well, let's use Twitter as an example.On Twitter, we send and we receive tweets.I don't want to go every day to my company Twitter pageto see all of the new tweets, etc.I can connect it to my Teams.And so, every new tweet will appear directly into the conversation feed.Once again, no need to use multiple applications, multiple web pages,everything is on Teams.Of course, I'm not going to make an example here because I thinkyou understand what's the use here.So now, let's talk a bit about our profile.How can we manage it?On the top right, you have your picture.If we click on it, to begin with, we have Change picture, right here.We click on Change picture, I can upload a new one or remove the picture.For now, this demonstration account has a perfect picture,let's not touch it.Then we have the Availability status.If you used to use Skype, you all know what is the availability status.But for the one who don't know, we have different statues on Teams.Available, I think it's pretty clear, we are available.You can send messages, you can call, everything's okay.Busy, once again, you can send messages, receive messages,take calls, receive calls, etc.But you are busy, which means that maybe you won't be able to answerbecause you are working.Maybe someone is going to send you a message.If you don't answer them, they are going to see the little Busy dot,""ah, yeah, he's busy, that's why he is not answering"".Do not disturb, I would go back in a few seconds.We have: Be right back, and Appear away.I think it's clear once again, I'm not on my computer for now.So there is a big chance that I won't answer your call, your message, etc.But I have still a chance, I guess.Then we have Do not disturb.Do not disturb, if you use it,people will still be able to send you messages, to call you,but you won't receive any notification.You won't receive any audio notification, you won't receive any visual notificationbecause you are in Do not disturb, you don't want to be disturbed.They still can try it, but you won't receive them.Let's go back on Available.Then we'll check Saved, right here.The Saved button is to see the different conversations that we have saved.How to save a conversation? Well, it's quite simple.We have a conversation right here being from me or from someone else.On the right, I have, right here, the little flag.I click on it to save the message.As you can see, saved.If I click on the Saved button,I will find back all of the different conversations that I saved.And so I can reread them whenever I want.Then we have the Settings.So let's check a bit the Settings.The Settings, once again, I won't go into all of thembecause there was a lot of settings in Teams,but you can change some general settings,Auto-start the application,On close, keep the application running,change the language, etc.And we have a lot of them.Of course, you can change the zoom,see the keyboard shortcuts about different information,check for updates, download the mobile app and sign out.I think everything is clear on it.Let's go now on the top left in Activity.In Activity, we have, to begin with, Feed.Feed will be all of the new notifications that are related to you.I guess someone liked a message,someone posted something in the channel that you are following.You will see every new notification on you.You missed a message, you missed a call, it would be in the notification.But if I click on Feed, I will have My Activity.In My Activity, you will find everything that you did.And, as you can see, it will not go back from hundred years,but you will find different things you did a few weeks before.As you can see, it's today, the different tabs.And we also have, on the bottom, a post I did a week away.So you would find back everything that you did.If you're a member of, let's say, 20 different teams,you don't want to write everything.""Today in the Marketing teams, I got something at X hour"", etc. Well, no.You go in My Activity,you will find back every information, everything that you've posted.It's easier for you to find back a conversation that is importantbecause you'll find the first message that you sent.And of course, on the top right, you can filter it.You can unread, mention, reply, following, etc.to make it easier to find a different notification if you have a lot of them, of course.Lastly, we want to talk about the instant messaging, the chat.By clicking on the Chat tab,I will be able to find back the group conversation, the one-to-one conversationand some suggested contacts for conversation.By clicking on the Contact tab,I will find all of my different contacts with such friend groups.As you can see, we have Favourites, Direction, (inaudible), etc.Let's click on the top right here.We have New chat.Let's create a new chat and let's send it to Oliver.So I can send a message to Oliver.""Hi Oliver.""I click on Enter and then my message is sent.As we did on the conversation feed before,I can change the format, send files, emojis, gif, stickersand I can also schedule meetings directly from my instant messaging.But I'm not going to talk about it here.I can add places and the three little dots to use different applications.Of course, I have different tabs on the top.The Files tab, to find all of the files that I've shared with Oliver.I have Organisation.We have not here, but it's what you see the organisation of the company.Activity, to see Oliver's activities on my different teams.We are part of the same teams, not all of them, but a few of them.I would be able to see what he did into those teams because I'm a part of it too.So it's a quick way to find different information as well.The little Plus button to add a tab.As you can see, we do not have a lot of tabs like we used to doon the specific teams or channels, but we still have a lot of them:Excel, OneNote, PDF, Power BI, PowerPoint, etc.And also, we have the Freehand, Freehand by Invision.Freehand, it’s a whiteboard, like we used to have on the Skype for example,a bit better, I want to say,but you can add the Freehand directly in a tab in a conversation,so you won't have to save every whiteboard that you use every time you are in a conversation.No, it will be automatically saved in a tab in the conversationthat you can find back whenever you want.On the top right, I can start a video conversation if I have a camera,an audio call, of course.On the far right, we can add people to this conversation.Let's add Lisa, for example.Now it's a group conversation.And lastly, I can share my screen if I click on it.As you can see, I have my different screens, my different windows.I can choose the one that I want to share, as simply as that.Let's go back on our PowerPoint.So to begin with, we had an issue.I wanted to access a customised workspace centralising a number of toolswhere I can experience collaborating working as well.We resolved that.In Teams, we can create a team to communicateand collaborate with the same team members.And, of course, I can add team members and simply communicate with our co-workers.I was looking for a turnkey solution to facilitate the communicationand collaboration within my team.Under the created team, I can directly add a channel.A channel is like a chat room, as we said, with a specific themethat you create for your team, events, services, miscellaneous.You can create any topic that you want.Your need, you needed a team to know when to reach you.So when the team members can see you are available or not.Because you are part of the team,the members will need to consult you from time to time on a particular issue.It's useful and necessary to have access to the availability status indicator.And as we saw, we have: Available, Busy, Do not disturb,Appear away or Away from computer.I needed to identify experts and obtain opinions from a group of people.Based on the idea that you can always view your activity history,you can follow the team activity on the navigation bar as well.Always stay abreast on your team's activity by placing yourself in the centre of the activity.You collaborate and you put yourself in a field of expertise identified by your staff.You wanted to ask the entire team a questionand simply consult their individual replieswithout mixing that information with your personal messages, of course.In Teams, you can organise your chats and calls by groups or on one to one, if you want.To exchange with all or part of the team, the chat box was intendedto respond to all your need and functions.The most important things to remember,Teams allows the creation of a collaborative space for targeted employees.Teams centralise all the necessary tools to teamwork.You can also customise your space.By adjusting your profile and availability status indicator,you can be reached at the right time.Quickly you can get updates on the latest information and chatsand you can use the chat tools to contact your company's key actors, the experts, when needed.If anyone has any question about the material presented just now,I would be happy to answer them.If no one has any question, we proceed to the next section.So, of course, we are going to talk about the MOOC platform.Everybody in here knows the MOOC platform because we had a few sessions together.So we already talked about that.Just remember, of course, on the MOOC training platform,you have different tabs: Learning paths, Courses,Tutorials, and Use Case Scenarios, and, of course, the calendar.The calendar to find depending on the day or data availablethe different training session that we have at this moment.You go for example on Tuesday, and on Tuesday, we have this session or that session.So it's easier for you to find the right time to do training session.And also do not forget about the Most Consulted, Recommended for you,and Most Recent training session to find what is the most interesting training sessions.For the Recommended for you tab, the more training sessions you do,the best easy algorithm about it.So the more you do training sessions,the more we can recommend for you training sessions,we will be really recommended for you and for what you like.Finally, I will thank you all for participating to this online session.It’s been a pleasure exchanging with you.Do enjoy your platform and get the most out of itand, most of all, I bid you all a pleasant day.",hello everyonewelcom onlin session call commun team teamsmi name thoma give present todaybefor start order ensur run smoothlyit import listen follow instruct carefullyther

Introduction to Microsoft Stream,"Welcome to this course, which will allow you to manage your business videos with Microsoft Stream.Microsoft Stream is a business video service, similar to Youtube, that is, a platform where you willbe able to upload and share with your associates video content created earlier, through a secure service.Begin by logging in to the Office 365 portal.If you cannot see Microsoft Stream on your home page, click on the icon on the top left of your screen,and select the application from the list.Of course, you will need a businesslicence in order to use Stream.In this video, we will discoverthe different ways of using this tool, as well as its limitations.Microsoft Stream has several features: itallows you to upload your videos onto the portal, to organise them in one or more channels, and to edit these videos or channels.When you put these videos online,you are also responsible for assigningpermissions to access their content.In the case of an Office 365 group,for example, all the group memberswill have the option of choosingthe people they want to share the video with.It is also possible to create a group directly from Stream.This option allows you to have access to a group conversation, a calendar, storage, etc., just like for any Office 365 group.Now let’s look at the video formats supported by Microsoft Stream.The application supports the most popular formats currently used on the Internet, such as MPEG2, AVI and MP4.You will find a list of all the formats supported in the user documentation on the Microsoft Website.The number of features that you can access will depend on your subscription.The storage capacity of your MicrosoftStream platform will also varyaccording to the numberof users in your group.To start with, you’ll have 500 GB.Then, you’ll have an additional 0.5 GB per licensed user.For example, if you have 10 users you will have access to 10 times 0.5 GB, in other words 5 GB inaddition to your initial allotment.Finally, here are a few of thelimitations associated with this application: your Stream Office 365 offer allows you to have a totalof 100,000 videos and 10,000 channels,each containing up to 10,000 videos.With respect to the display, youhave five thumbnails per video.However, you don’t need to use allfive thumbnails each time.One might be enough.Each video can display up to 2,500 comments, and you can upload videosup to 50 GB.Each user can upload up to 5,000videos, 1,000 channels and 50,000 comments.If this licence is not adequate for your needs, you will need to contact Microsoft for an enhanced licence.",welcom cours allow manag busi video microsoft streammicrosoft stream busi video servic similar youtub platform willb abl upload share associ video content creat earlier secur servicebegin log offic 365 portalif see microsoft stream home page click icon top left screenand select applic listof cours need businesslic order use streamin video discoverth differ way use tool well limitationsmicrosoft stream sever featur itallow upload video onto portal organis one channel edit video channelswhen put video onliney also respons assigningpermiss access contentin case offic 365 groupfor exampl group memberswil option choosingth peopl want share video withit also possibl creat group directli streamthi option allow access group convers calendar storag etc like offic 365 groupnow let look video format support microsoft streamth applic support popular format current use internet mpeg2 avi mp4you find list format support user document microsoft websiteth number featur access depend subscriptionth storag capac microsoftstream platform also varyaccord numberof user groupto start youll 500 gbthen youll addit 05 gb per licens userfor exampl 10 user access 10 time 05 gb word 5 gb inaddit initi allotmentfin thelimit associ applic stream offic 365 offer allow totalof 100000 video 10000 channelseach contain 10000 videoswith respect display youhav five thumbnail per videohowev dont need use allfiv thumbnail timeon might enougheach video display 2500 comment upload videosup 50 gbeach user upload 5000video 1000 channel 50000 commentsif licenc adequ need need contact microsoft enhanc licenc

you want to uploaddirectly onto the page.The screen will turn white to indicatethat Stream is ready to receive your files.Of course, you also have the option of uploading several files at once.Next, select the default language for your video.This option is not compulsory, butit allows you to automatically generate a caption file for thelanguages supported, and it makes your video easier to retrieve.While your videos are uploading onto the platform, you can begin to edit different information about them.Give a name to your video and add a description.You can add hashtags in the description.These are keywords that begin with the number symbol (#) and that allow you to group videos with similar content.For example, if you write “#windows10”in your video description, users will be able to click on this hashtagand find all the other videos containing the same reference.You also have the option of adding time codes  in the form of H:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds), for the purpose of creating  an interactive table of contents.Your users will then be able to directly access the corresponding passages in the video.Finally, you can enter links in the description to refer users directly to the website in question.If you did not define the languagein the previous step, you can do so here.Next, choose the thumbnail to be displayed for your video among the ones suggested, or add your own image by clicking on the “+” button.Under the “Permissions” tab, you will be able to define the access permissions for your video.Check this box if you want to makethe video accessible to everyone in your company.You can also choose to share a videoin one of your channels with your groups, or just with certain people.Do a search or create a new groupor a new channel for your video.The “Viewers” section allows you to grant permissions to access and edit your video.By default, you own the videos that you have uploaded onto Stream.Check the “Owner” box for the other observers you want to authorizeto edit the video information.They will also be able to choosewho can access the video.Check the “Display” box if you wantto display the video in the corresponding group.Please note, however, that this option will only appear if you are authorized to add to videos in that group.The “Options” tab will allow youto enable or disable comments under the video.You can also automatically generate a transcript file, with subtitlesin the language of your video, oradd your own transcript file.This file will also allow you toobtain better results using the smart search tools in Microsoft Stream.Finally, the “Subtitles” sectionwill allow you to add files of subtitles in other languages.Once you have filled in all this information, you will have two options.You can share the video.To do this, you will get a sharelink that you can send directlyto people so that they will be ableto use and view the video.You also have the option of havinga code embedded in your video that you can copy directly into yourcompany website, for instance.The “Publish now” button allows you to post the video directly on the channel or on the group pagethat you have chosen for this video.You can upload new videos at any time.To do this, all you need to do is click on “Create” in your navigation bar, and then on “Upload a video”, or simply click on this icon on the top

Forward your Skype calls to your mobile phone,"I’m not in my office very often because the company is large and my duties as a support technician require me to be available for other people in the organization’s various locations. Even if I have a work landline number and a mobile number, I don’t want to give my mobile number to everyone,particularly external partners. I prefer to keep it for emergencies. How can I retrieve the calls made to my landline when I’m out of the office? What peripheral device should I use for my calls? My Skype for Business number allows me to receive calls directly on my PC.This number is managed like a regular landline number. In fact, it is in my Outlook signature, but it is not attached to just one phone. It allows me to automatically forward calls to another phone or to have a second phone ring simultaneously. I’m going to open this menu, which allows me to find both options. In my case, I would like my mobile phone to ring at same time as my PC when I receive a call on my landline. That way, I will at least have the choice of picking up the call on my PC if I’m in my office, or on my mobile if I’m out of the office. All I need to do is enter my mobile number or the number for the phone that I would like to ring as well. As soon as I receive the call, it will reach my PC as well as the destination I entered, in this case, my mobile phone. If, however, I want this to happen only at certain times of the day, for example during my working hours, this is definitely possible. Going back to the options, here I can choose whether or not the simultaneous call settings are applied all the time or during working hours. This suits me perfectly. If someone calls after my working hours, I would not have the simultaneous ringing. As a reminder, you can enter your working hours in your Outlook calendar settings.  If you go through your Outlook Online, for instance, you will find your working hours here. The features in Skype for Business are very flexible and offer a wide range of options for your telephony needs. Arrange to forward your calls to another phone. Enable the option only during your working hours to be sure that you will not receive any calls outside of those hours. Forward your missed calls so that they can be received on another device instead of going to your voicemail.

"Business Teams! Support Your Tenders, Entirely Remotely!","You are responding to an important call for tenders from abroad. To do this, you have to create a team to prepare the tender documents. You need several colleagues (a technical expert, a product manager, technicians, etc.)In a few days, you will need to support your tender. You need to be efficient and act quickly. How can you put together a team and have everyone work together without wasting time? How can you support your tender from across the globe? First of all, I will create my team in Teams. This will allow us to discuss and centralize all the components for this call for tenders. All I need to do is enter a name and then add the members.That way, I already have a space to store the documents and a joint notepad for everyone to use. I am going to add a “Planner” tab, which will allow me to list and distribute tasks for responding to this call for tenders. We have six weeks to prepare our tender.To touch base regularly with the team, I am going to schedule two regular meetings each week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. Still in Teams, I go to the “Meetings” tab. I click on “Schedule a meeting” to choose the relevant team and then I choose the frequency.Each associate will be able to join the online meeting directly in Teams. We all have access to the shared documents, the notepad and the “Planner” to know how work is progressing. After a few weeks, we reach our goal. All there is left to do is to make a presentation in supportof our tender, which we will manage remotely as the client is based in Australia. To do this, we will use Skype for Business. I invite the participants to join a meeting in Outlook, as for a traditional meeting. However, I need to take time zones into consideration. I don't worry about whether they have the Skype application on their PC.With this link, they’ll be able to connect to the Skype for Web version, which will allow them to see my screen and the video conference.During the conference, I share the documents as well as my video. Meanwhile, I stay in contact with the team through chat, which allows me to ask questions and get answers live. The two Skype windows are separate from each other. With collaborative tools, it’s no longer necessary to be physically close.Set up a temporary team, even for just a few weeks, and start collaborating immediately. Take advantage of webconferencing to support your business proposals using Skype, without having to travel across the world.",respond import call tender abroad creat team prepar tender document need sever colleagu technic expert product manag technician etcin day need support tender need effici act quickli put togeth team everyon work togeth without wast time support tender across globe first creat team team allow us discuss central compon call tender need enter name add membersthat way alreadi space store document joint notepad everyon use go add planner tab allow list distribut task respond call tender six week prepar tenderto touch base regularli team go schedul two regular meet week one tuesday one thursday still team go meet tab click schedul meet choos relev team choos frequencyeach associ abl join onlin meet directli team access share document notepad planner know work progress week reach goal left make present supportof tender manag remot client base australia use skype busi invit particip join meet outlook tradit meet howev need take time zone consider dont worri whether skype applic pcwith link theyll abl connect skype web version allow see screen video conferencedur confer share document well video meanwhil stay contact team chat allow ask question get answer live two skype window separ collabor tool longer necessari physic closeset temporari team even week start collabor immedi take advantag webconferenc support busi propos use skype without travel across world
Finalizing a Business Presentation from Home,"You have a business. You work closely with your business assistant and a technical expert. You need to prepare a presentation for an important client that you will be meeting with this afternoon. To cut down on travel time, you would like to work from home. But how can you work with your colleagues who are at the office? Will you need to email them the various components and wait until everyone finishes their part in order to finalize the document as a whole? I don’t have much time left to finalize this business presentation that will provide me with support this afternoon when I meet with my client. All I need to do is connect to my Office 365 space, even from home. I have access to all the tools through the portal. First of all, I will make the presentation available in my OneDrive so that my colleagues can view it.  I will then share the document with them so that they can edit it. I have to hold an impromptu meeting with these two colleagues so that we can coordinate our work properly. I will go onto Skype to check their availability. Both of them are available. I can send them an instant message to suggest that we have an impromptu meeting. It’s perfect. Both of them are available for a meeting on short notice. I will start an audio conference. From there, I will share my screen to explain to them in practical terms what I expect from them in the shared document. Each one of us will be able to use the “Open” button so we can all work together on the same document.With the co-editing feature, PowerPoint invites you to see other users while they are editing in real time. I know exactly which slide my colleagues are editing. In addition, you can have a Chat window that allows you to remain in contact in real time while each person is editing. There might be questions and I am often online, so chatting remains the best way to discuss. Once finished, I would like my business manager to approve the document before it is sent to the client. I can share the document with him directly from PowerPoint Online.Once a document has been approved, I usually file it and make it available to the rest of the business team. In OneDrive, I am going to select the presentation in order to move it. I choose the SharePoint space for the business team where I would like this document to be moved. This is the right document library where all my colleagues from the business team store their final presentations. This is the best way to have the documents in a central location and to leverage knowledge. The document is now ready. I still have a few adjustments to make, and I’ll be able to do this on my way to the meeting. On my smartphone, I will access either the SharePoint application to retrieve the PowerPoint presentation,or the PowerPoint application directly, which will logically suggest the presentation I just worked on in my list of recent documents. Office 365 allows you to work remotely without any restrictions. Share a document, contact your colleagues, meet around a shared screen, co-edit a presentation and share it with others, all of this remotely, from any type of hardware.",busi work close busi assist technic expert need prepar present import client meet afternoon cut travel time would like work home work colleagu offic need email variou compon wait everyon finish part order final document whole dont much time left final busi present provid support afternoon meet client need connect offic 365 space even home access tool portal first make present avail onedr colleagu view share document edit hold impromptu meet two colleagu coordin work properli go onto skype check avail avail send instant messag suggest impromptu meet perfect avail meet short notic start audio confer share screen explain practic term expect share document one us abl use open button work togeth documentwith coedit featur powerpoint invit see user edit real time know exactli slide colleagu edit addit chat window allow remain contact real time person edit might question often onlin chat remain best way discuss finish would like busi manag approv document sent client share document directli powerpoint onlineonc document approv usual file make avail rest busi team onedr go select present order move choos sharepoint space busi team would like document move right document librari colleagu busi team store final present best way document central locat leverag knowledg document readi still adjust make ill abl way meet smartphon access either sharepoint applic retriev powerpoint presentationor powerpoint applic directli logic suggest present work list recent document offic 365 allow work remot without restrict share document contact colleagu meet around share screen coedit present share other remot type hardwar
Optimising the Effectiveness of the Business Team,"You are part of a business team made up of about fifteen colleagues, located throughout the country. You have very few opportunities to see one another, but you know that it’s important to share your sales experience and techniques.Should you continue to have everyone meet at head office and lose up to two days that you could be spending in the field? You’re not happy with how often these meetings take place, and you’re not able to have effective discussions with all of your colleagues on those days. How can you encourage the members of your business team to discuss and share their experience? My business team has discussions every day, in spite of geographical distance. This is possible using Teams, where we created a team with several discussion channels. The channels allow us to discuss various subjects on a daily basis: Feedback, product evolution, prospecting and selling techniques.Every day, I check my notifications and I participate in exchanges and discussions. In just a few minutes, I can stay in contact with my colleagues, keep informed about new business files and talk about our selling techniques. Here, for example, “Frank ” Is asking us for the technical specifications of a product. I’ve already had a chance to get this information, so I’ll help him save time by forwarding the document that will answer his question. During discussions, you also have the option of adding documents.And that’s not all. I have planned a weekly update that we can do remotely, directly in Teams.On Monday mornings, all you need to do is click on “Join Microsoft Teams Meeting” to join the web conference [meeting]. One hour is enough to review our progress to date and plan for the coming week. You no longer have to travel long distances, which is costly and time-consuming. Finally, to maintain a spirit of challenge, I regularly update information about our progress in an Excel file, which I post using Power BI.All you have to do is add a tab and point your cursor to the Power BI file. That way, still without leaving Teams, business team members can follow the day-to-day sales activity and compare their results.Using Teams, you can remain in contact with your colleagues, leverage your knowledge and collaborate without wasting time attending lengthy, inefficient meetings. By using Power BI in Teams view for your results and dashboards, you can maintain a spirit of challenge in your business team.",part busi team made fifteen colleagu locat throughout countri opportun see one anoth know import share sale experi techniquesshould continu everyon meet head offic lose two day could spend field your happi often meet take place your abl effect discuss colleagu day encourag member busi team discuss share experi busi team discuss everi day spite geograph distanc possibl use team creat team sever discuss channel channel allow us discuss variou subject daili basi feedback product evolut prospect sell techniqueseveri day check notif particip exchang discuss minut stay contact colleagu keep inform new busi file talk sell techniqu exampl frank ask us technic specif product ive alreadi chanc get inform ill help save time forward document answer question discuss also option ad documentsand that plan weekli updat remot directli teamson monday morn need click join microsoft team meet join web confer meet one hour enough review progress date plan come week longer travel long distanc costli timeconsum final maintain spirit challeng regularli updat inform progress excel file post use power biall add tab point cursor power bi file way still without leav team busi team member follow daytoday sale activ compar resultsus team remain contact colleagu leverag knowledg collabor without wast time attend lengthi ineffici meet use power bi team view result dashboard maintain spirit challeng busi team
Teamwork - Guiding and Organizing Your Business Activity,"You are responsible for several worksites, and your teams are geographically scattered. You want to organise the task distribution and inform each associate of the actions they need to take. How will you inform each associate of their job tasks? How will you collaborate when you are out of the office? How will you manage and track your teams’ activity using your mobile phone? And, when a new member joins your team, how will you give them access to the activity planner? I log into the Office 365 portal, and then I access the team’s Planner.With just a few clicks, I can view the activity by bucket. At a glance, I can view the project progress, the activity distribution by worksite and the tasks assigned to each associate. In order to finish the task on time on the Subway worksite, I will increase the staff by adding an extra person who is available.The associate will be notified by email about their new assignment. On another worksite, a team needs to go through the same checklist as on the one on the Subway worksite. So I duplicate the task, keep the same checklist and assign it to this worksite,and then I add the person who will do this job. While I am out of the office visiting a worksite, I notice an anomaly that needs to be addressed by a member of my team. I respond by accessing the Planner mobile application.I open the corresponding worksite and I create a new task, which I assign to an associate. I take a picture, and I add a description of the actions to be taken.On my way back to the office, I prepare the end-of-the-week  team meeting on the OneNote mobile application. At the office, I finalize the meeting agenda that I started on the mobile application.In my Outlook, I post the group calendar and I create an online meeting using Skype. The list of recipients is automatically displayed. I enter the subject, and I include the notes shared by the team.During the meeting, I make note of who is present.During the meeting, I share notes using Skype.That way, each member contributes in real time to completing the minutes, and my team will become more efficient and will save time. At the end of the meeting, there is no need to send any minutes, as the people who were absent will be able to view a summary on their smartphone using the OneNote mobile application.Currently, my team is quickly informed of the actions to take and notified of new tasks to perform. Any new associate joining the team will have access to all pertinent documents and meeting minutes. They even have access to this information on their phone, using either mobile applications or their smartphone browser.",respons sever worksit team geograph scatter want organis task distribut inform associ action need take inform associ job task collabor offic manag track team activ use mobil phone new member join team give access activ planner log offic 365 portal access team plannerwith click view activ bucket glanc view project progress activ distribut worksit task assign associ order finish task time subway worksit increas staff ad extra person availableth associ notifi email new assign anoth worksit team need go checklist one subway worksit duplic task keep checklist assign worksiteand add person job offic visit worksit notic anomali need address member team respond access planner mobil applicationi open correspond worksit creat new task assign associ take pictur add descript action takenon way back offic prepar endoftheweek team meet onenot mobil applic offic final meet agenda start mobil applicationin outlook post group calendar creat onlin meet use skype list recipi automat display enter subject includ note share teamdur meet make note presentdur meet share note use skypethat way member contribut real time complet minut team becom effici save time end meet need send minut peopl absent abl view summari smartphon use onenot mobil applicationcurr team quickli inform action take notifi new task perform new associ join team access pertin document meet minut even access inform phone use either mobil applic smartphon browser
Teamwork - Improving Collaboration and Facilitating Data Sharing,"You are an advertising manager, and your team is geographically scattered. You want to lead the team, organize weekly meetings, and report actions and minutes of the meetings. You want to share documents and discuss with your associates without overwhelming them with information and without having to send them emails. How will you give them access to the latest version of the document? How will you collaborate when you are out of the office? How can you give them access to this information through their mobile phones? And, when a new member joins your team, how will you give them access to the planner and the minutes of previous meetings? I log into the portal and then I access my inbox. For my team to have access to a set of documents and information from Outlook, I create a Group, add the members, and immediately have a SharePoint space that can be customized to promote collaboration and data sharing. To facilitate access to information, I will customize the homepage of the SharePoint site.In just a few clicks, I will create a new home page containing the team’s planner, meeting minutes and links to the main indicators, as well as new documentation. Under the “Pages” tab, I will create a new page for the site. I click on “New”, and I start with the heading and an explanation of the page content.Next, I add a page of quick links to access the various items that my associates will require. First of all, I create a link to a Power BI graph illustrating the team’s sales. To the right of the screen, I name the link and insert a visual based on a previously downloaded image.If necessary, I add an alternate text for those who can’t view the image. I add a link to the team’s appointment planner, which is stored in the documentary database of the site.Then I do the same for the minutes of my team’s meetings. I create a link to the team’s notepad. I add a Group calendar below for team meetings.Finally, I add a section on site activity so that, for example, my team will be informed of the latest files that have been edited. I save the information and post my page.Finally, I define the page that I created as my site's homepage.Currently, my team is informed of documents that have been edited and can quickly access sales indicators.  Any new associate who joins the team will have access to all the documents and meeting minutes. They will even have access to this information on their phone, using either mobile applications or their smartphone browser.",advertis manag team geograph scatter want lead team organ weekli meet report action minut meet want share document discuss associ without overwhelm inform without send email give access latest version document collabor offic give access inform mobil phone new member join team give access planner minut previou meet log portal access inbox team access set document inform outlook creat group add member immedi sharepoint space custom promot collabor data share facilit access inform custom homepag sharepoint sitein click creat new home page contain team planner meet minut link main indic well new document page tab creat new page site click new start head explan page contentnext add page quick link access variou item associ requir first creat link power bi graph illustr team sale right screen name link insert visual base previous download imageif necessari add altern text cant view imag add link team appoint planner store documentari databas sitethen minut team meet creat link team notepad add group calendar team meetingsfin add section site activ exampl team inform latest file edit save inform post pagefin defin page creat site homepagecurr team inform document edit quickli access sale indic new associ join team access document meet minut even access inform phone use either mobil applic smartphon browser
Introduction to the course on Forms,"Hello and welcome!Today, we will be discussing “Forms” software.To start, let’s look at what Forms is used for.Forms is a tool for creating forms, questionnaires and surveys.Everyone will have the opportunity not only to create a form or a questionnaire, but also to use the results.Currently, there is no online version of this application, so you must use the Office 365 interface and choose “Forms”.The purpose of these videos is to explain how Forms software works,from creating to publishing a form or a questionnaire.Following is the outline of this video module.First we will see how to create a form or a questionnaire, because these are two very different tasks.In fact, the purpose of a form is to collect the impressions and feelings of other people, while questionnaires are useful for testing someone’s knowledge.Next, for both of these cases, we will see how to share and then use the results obtained with a form or a questionnaire.We will then see how to copy and edit a form.In Forms, it is possible to collaborate with others on the same form.We will therefore examine how toshare information for collaboratingand then how to stop sharing.Finally, we will look at the various options using OneDrive and thenthe settings recommended to the Office 365 administrator for this application.",hello welcometoday discuss form softwareto start let look form use forform tool creat form questionnair surveyseveryon opportun creat form questionnair also use resultscurr onlin version applic must use offic 365 interfac choos formsth purpos video explain form softwar worksfrom creat publish form questionnairefollow outlin video modulefirst see creat form questionnair two differ tasksin fact purpos form collect impress feel peopl questionnair use test someon knowledgenext case see share use result obtain form questionnairew see copi edit formin form possibl collabor other formw therefor examin toshar inform collaboratingand stop sharingfin look variou option use onedr thenth set recommend offic 365 administr applic
Creating a Form,"Let’s now create our first form.From this section, you can add atitle as well as a description to the form.By clicking on this icon, you canadd an image to the form, either from an Internet search, from OneDrive or even from your computer.Let’s use this image.It is now displayed beside the title.Data is automatically saved, and so there is little risk of losing what you have created.Let’s add a first question.Here is how we can formulate thechoice of responses.There is a sequencing tool thatallows you to change the order of questions, if you want to.I will now create my first question:“Do you know how to use Microsoft Forms?” “Yes/No” When you click on “Add option”, a new response option will be displayed.When you click on “Add ‘other’ option”, a new option called “Other” will be displayed.You can choose whether there are several responses and whether it is compulsory to respond to a particular question.Once again, it is possible to addan image associated with the question.Let’s now create a text question.The question will simply be “Nameand Surname” with the option of answering in free form in a textbox under this question.Now you can put the questions backin the desired order by clickingon the two arrows located right here.The “Name and Surname” questionwill therefore be the first question from now on.Next, let’s add another question.This time, let’s choose “Rating”.You can choose the level and symbolused for this type of question.The question is “Do you think this form is useful?” The respondents will then choose how they rate the form by clicking on one of the stars.Finally, let’s add a last questionabout the “date”, that is, “When did you fill this form?”.The respondents can then choosea date to respond to this questionby clicking on the calendar icon.When you click on “preview”, a “Form view” will appear, allowing you to see the same thing as the survey participants.Several views are possible on acomputer or mobile device.Let’s now look at branching.By clicking on the Settings icon,we will access a drop-down menu.Let’s now click on “branching”.This will allow us to choose the next question to be answered,depending on the participant’s response.For example, if the participant answered “No” to question 2, they will need to skip question 3 and go directly to question 4.If you go back into Settings, youwill find other options that can be changed.Firstly, various options are availableto choose who can complete the questionnaire.Everyone or only the members of the organization?Also, various response options are available, including “Accept responses, Start date, End date, Shuffle questions”.You also have the option of receiving“Email notification of each response”.Finally, let’s click on”Share”.Will the form be shared  only an Internet link?Or a QR Code?Will it be directly embedded in a website?Or will it be sent by email?And, of course, you have the option of sharing it as an example or sharingit with your colleagues to allowfor synchronous or asynchronous editing purposes.",let creat first formfrom section add atitl well descript formbi click icon canadd imag form either internet search onedr even computerlet use imageit display besid titledata automat save littl risk lose createdlet add first questionher formul thechoic responsesther sequenc tool thatallow chang order question want toi creat first questiondo know use microsoft form yesno click add option new respons option displayedwhen click add option new option call displayedy choos whether sever respons whether compulsori respond particular questiononc possibl addan imag associ questionlet creat text questionth question simpli nameand surnam option answer free form textbox questionnow put question backin desir order clickingon two arrow locat right hereth name surnam questionwil therefor first question onnext let add anoth questionthi time let choos ratingy choos level symbolus type questionth question think form use respond choos rate form click one starsfin let add last questionabout date fill formth respond choosea date respond questionbi click calendar iconwhen click preview form view appear allow see thing survey participantssever view possibl acomput mobil devicelet look branchingbi click set iconw access dropdown menulet click branchingthi allow us choos next question answereddepend particip responsefor exampl particip answer question 2 need skip question 3 go directli question 4if go back set youwil find option changedfirstli variou option availableto choos complet questionnaireeveryon member organizationalso variou respons option avail includ accept respons start date end date shuffl questionsy also option receivingemail notif responsefin let click onsharewil form share internet linkor qr codewil directli embed websiteor sent emailand cours option share exampl sharingit colleagu allowfor synchron asynchron edit purpos
Sharing and viewing Responses,"Let’s click on “Share” and copy the Internet link to insert it directly in an email.You will need to click on the“Copy”button to copy the link, and then all you will need to do isopen Outlook to send the link by email.Let’s insert the survey link with the message “Hello, fill this please”.Now that the email has been sent,let’s look at it from the recipient’s point of view.Once I click on the link, I can access the questions directly.Just by clicking, we can now complete the questionnaire.Even if the recipient does not haveOffice 365 or is not a member of our organisation, they will also be able to complete the questionnaire.Going back to Forms as the form owner, we can see the responses that were added right here.We can also see the dashboard, which indicates the average time used to fill in the questionnaire and other information, such as the status.Details about the responses are also available.You can also use Excel with Forms.By transferring the responses into Excel, you can now compile statisticsusing the various data.There is no need to go back to thequestionnaire every day to be informed of new responses.In fact, a notification is automatically sent by email each time a participant completes the questionnaire.",let click share copi internet link insert directli emaily need click thecopybutton copi link need isopen outlook send link emaillet insert survey link messag hello fill pleasenow email sentlet look recipi point viewonc click link access question directlyjust click complet questionnaireeven recipi haveoffic 365 member organis also abl complet questionnairego back form form owner see respons ad right herew also see dashboard indic averag time use fill questionnair inform statusdetail respons also availabley also use excel formsbi transfer respons excel compil statisticsus variou datather need go back thequestionnair everi day inform new responsesin fact notif automat sent email time particip complet questionnair

Let’s now add the last question,which will be a multiple-choice question.“What is the name of our training portal?” Let’s add several responses in text format.- SOOC - DOOC - MOOC - LOOC There you go.We have now created our questionnaire with a few responses, and it will look like this.Let’s now share our questionnaireby clicking on “Share”so that the participants can complete it quickly.",let creat questionnairewith form click new quizlet call gener knowledgeand add photo correspond themejust like form addan evalu question date question whether option alloc point whether number question compulsoryy also option ad mathemat formula click hereth interfac chang inord insert mathemat formulasa proven respons suggest click respons ad validatedlet add text questionwhat celebr 1st may go enter sever option add five point right respons let add last questionwhich multiplechoic questionwhat name train portal let add sever respons text format sooc dooc mooc looc gow creat questionnair respons look like thislet share questionnairebi click shareso particip complet quickli

Facilitating Mobility by Creating Your Own Application,"You wish to expand your business activities by conquering new markets. However, this expansion will cost a lot of money due to the acquisition of new office space and the recruiting of new staff.This reality has motivated you to adopt a new strategy by facilitating telecommuting and home working. Most of your employees use a smartphone. How can you take advantage of the tools already available in your organization? How many applications do you need to grow your business? How can you develop these applications at the lowest cost? How can you centralize all these utilities using a single application?Microsoft PowerApps is the ideal solution to facilitate your staff’s mobility. It allows you to quickly produce applications without any specific programming knowledge. When you go to the home page, you have several options: launching the creation of your application from scratch, from data or from existing templates. These templates are ready-to-use applications that you can quickly adapt to your needs.When you hover your mouse over one of these templates, a description of the way it works will be displayed. You can also test the template before beginning to adapt and customize it.When you choose a template, all you need to do is click on “Make this app” to start customizing it. Let’s take this template, for example. It will allow my employees to show samples and to estimate the cost of a job directly on the client’s premises. First, I determine where my data will be stored by linking my application to one of my storage spaces. After a few customizations, my application is now ready to be shared. To do this, I go to the “File” menu, and I give the application a name and save it. I can then share this application with my staff. Here, I have the option of informing my colleagues one at a time, or making the application available to my entire organization. For their part, my colleagues only need to install the PowerApps mobile version to find all the utilities that I shared with them. This allows me to centralize all the tools that I create in PowerApps, which makes it very easy for users. PowerApps was designed to facilitate your staff’s mobility and work. With PowerApps, creating mobile applications has never been easier. Using PowerApps helps you to save a lot of time and money.",wish expand busi activ conquer new market howev expans cost lot money due acquisit new offic space recruit new staffthi realiti motiv adopt new strategi facilit telecommut home work employe use smartphon take advantag tool alreadi avail organ mani applic need grow busi develop applic lowest cost central util use singl applicationmicrosoft powerapp ideal solut facilit staff mobil allow quickli produc applic without specif program knowledg go home page sever option launch creation applic scratch data exist templat templat readytous applic quickli adapt needswhen hover mous one templat descript way work display also test templat begin adapt custom itwhen choos templat need click make app start custom let take templat exampl allow employe show sampl estim cost job directli client premis first determin data store link applic one storag space custom applic readi share go file menu give applic name save share applic staff option inform colleagu one time make applic avail entir organ part colleagu need instal powerapp mobil version find util share allow central tool creat powerapp make easi user powerapp design facilit staff mobil work powerapp creat mobil applic never easier use powerapp help save lot time money
StaffHub - Creating a Digital Work Schedule for Your Field Teams,"Part of your team is working in the field. These staff members are mobile and you need to ask them on a regular basis to come into the office to touch base and to pick up a printed copy of the work schedule. How can you replace your printed work schedule with a digital version? How can you share it with these team members, who don’t have a PC or an email box? How can you send them important information without asking them to come into the office? StaffHub allows you to remain in contact with your field teams. All you need is one smartphone per user. In order to create a work schedule, you first need to create your team in the manager section of StaffHub.I launch the application from the Office 365 home page. I can find it in the list of applications. The first time that I launch StaffHub, I can create my team in less than two minutes. First, I enter the team name. I choose the time zone. Once the team has been created, I can also organise it by group. For example, in my restaurant, I prefer to separate the dining room staff from the cooks. Once the team and the groups have been formed, I can add members to the team. When you create your team, the members receive a link by SMS to download the application on their phone. I can now prepare my work schedule for one or more weeks.For each “Shift”, I will be able to add notes or important information, either for the entire team or for one person in particular. That way, I won’t have to contact my various associates separately by phone to give them instructions or information.When the work schedule is ready, I can share it, which will automatically notify my colleagues that I have just published a new work schedule. Of course, this is not set in stone. If I need to change the work schedule, I can simply make the necessary corrections and then post the information. I can then choose to inform everyone or only the team members affected by this change. StaffHub has allowed me to better organise work for my field teams. Don’t lose contact with these associates. Take advantage of the smartphone to use digital technology with your field staff. Do away with printed work schedules that can’t be changed and are difficult to share.",part team work field staff member mobil need ask regular basi come offic touch base pick print copi work schedul replac print work schedul digit version share team member dont pc email box send import inform without ask come offic staffhub allow remain contact field team need one smartphon per user order creat work schedul first need creat team manag section staffhubi launch applic offic 365 home page find list applic first time launch staffhub creat team less two minut first enter team name choos time zone team creat also organis group exampl restaur prefer separ dine room staff cook team group form add member team creat team member receiv link sm download applic phone prepar work schedul one weeksfor shift abl add note import inform either entir team one person particular way wont contact variou associ separ phone give instruct informationwhen work schedul readi share automat notifi colleagu publish new work schedul cours set stone need chang work schedul simpli make necessari correct post inform choos inform everyon team member affect chang staffhub allow better organis work field team dont lose contact associ take advantag smartphon use digit technolog field staff away print work schedul cant chang difficult share
StaffHub - Communicate Quickly with Your Field Staff,"Ihre Teamkollegen sind den ganzen Tag unterwegs. Sie möchten sie über die Neuigkeiten Ihres Unternehmens auf dem Laufenden halten und ihnen Zugang zu Installationsverfahren verschaffen. Wie können Sie die Distanz zwischen Ihnen und Ihren Mitarbeitern bewältigen, die keinen Zugang zu den gleichen Werkzeugen haben wie Ihre Mitarbeiter im Büro? Wie können Sie darauf reagieren, wenn wichtige Informationen an alle weitergegeben werden müssen? Müssen Sie in der Zentrale Meetings organisieren, um sie über die Neuigkeiten Ihres Unternehmens zu informieren und die Abläufe zu vertreiben? Für meine Teammitglieder, die mobil sind, nutze ich bereits die mobile Anwendung StaffHub, um ihre Arbeit zu organisieren.Jeder erhält seinen Arbeitsplan bereits durch die Bewerbung. Darüber hinaus umfasst StaffHub Kommunikations-und Content-Distributions-Tools. Heute habe ich zum Beispiel zwei wichtige Informationen an sie zu übermitteln. Die erste betrifft nur die Teammitglieder, die heute arbeiten. Ich muss sie darüber informieren, dass sich die Lieferung eines unserer Schlüsselprodukte verzögern wird. Dazu werde ich über die mobile Anwendung Sofortnachrichten verwenden. In diesem Fall muss ich mit den Teammitgliedern kommunizieren, die heute arbeiten. StaffHub hebt sie für mich hervor. Ich muss sie nur einzeln auswählen. Ich brauche nicht aufzuschauen, wer arbeitet und wer nicht. Sie können mir direkt antworten, um den Eingang meiner Nachricht zu bestätigen.Die zweite Information bezieht sich auf ein neues Verfahren zur Küchensicherheit, das ich mit ihnen teilen möchte. In diesem Fall werde ich stattdessen eine Datei verschicken, da das Verfahren in einem PDF-Dokument ist. In meinem Manager-Raum muss ich einfach eine Datei hinzufügen. Und dann kann ich bei Bedarf noch einen Kommentar hinzufügen. Die Datei wird sofort über die mobile Anwendung gesendet. Alle Teammitglieder können dieses Dokument über die Bewerbung lesen, wenn sie eintreffen, wenn sie zum Zeitpunkt oder später arbeiten. Das Dokument wird in der Rubrik ""Dateien"" angezeigt. StaffHub ermöglicht es Ihnen, mit Ihren Teamkollegen in diesem Bereich in Kontakt zu bleiben. Es ermöglicht Ihnen, schnell zu reagieren, wenn nötig, mit Instant Messaging. Für weniger dringende Informationen, die zur Verfügung gestellt werden müssen, ist das Hinzufügen eines Dokuments hilfreich für Benutzer, die keinen Computer haben. Seit ich StaffHub benutze, ist es für mich nicht mehr nötig, gedruckte Kopien von zu verteilenden Verfahren zu drucken.",ihr teamkollegen sind den ganzen tag unterweg sie möchten sie über die neuigkeiten ihr unternehmen auf dem laufenden halten und ihnen zugang zu installationsverfahren verschaffen wie können sie die distanz zwischen ihnen und ihren mitarbeitern bewältigen die keinen zugang zu den gleichen werkzeugen haben wie ihr mitarbeit im büro wie können sie darauf reagieren wenn wichtig informationen all weitergegeben werden müssen müssen sie der zentral meet organisieren um sie über die neuigkeiten ihr unternehmen zu informieren und die abläuf zu vertreiben für mein teammitglied die mobil sind nutz ich bereit die mobil anwendung staffhub um ihr arbeit zu organisierenjed erhält seinen arbeitsplan bereit durch die bewerbung darüber hinau umfasst staffhub kommunikationsund contentdistributionstool heut habe ich zum beispiel zwei wichtig informationen sie zu übermitteln die erst betrifft nur die teammitglied die heut arbeiten ich muss sie darüber informieren dass sich die lieferung ein unser schlüsselprodukt verzögern wird dazu werd ich über die mobil anwendung sofortnachrichten verwenden diesem fall muss ich mit den teammitgliedern kommunizieren die heut arbeiten staffhub hebt sie für mich hervor ich muss sie nur einzeln auswählen ich brauch nicht aufzuschauen wer arbeitet und wer nicht sie können mir direkt antworten um den eingang meiner nachricht zu bestätigendi zweit inform bezieht sich auf ein neue verfahren zur küchensicherheit da ich mit ihnen teilen möchte diesem fall werd ich stattdessen ein datei verschicken da da verfahren einem pdfdokument ist meinem managerraum muss ich einfach ein datei hinzufügen und dann kann ich bei bedarf noch einen kommentar hinzufügen die datei wird sofort über die mobil anwendung gesendet all teammitglied können dies dokument über die bewerbung lesen wenn sie eintreffen wenn sie zum zeitpunkt oder später arbeiten da dokument wird der rubrik dateien angezeigt staffhub ermöglicht es ihnen mit ihren teamkollegen diesem bereich kontakt zu bleiben es ermöglicht ihnen schnell zu reagieren wenn nötig mit instant messag für wenig dringend informationen die zur verfügung gestellt werden müssen ist da hinzufügen ein dokument hilfreich für benutz die keinen comput haben seit ich staffhub benutz ist es für mich nicht mehr nötig gedruckt kopien von zu verteilenden verfahren zu drucken
StaffHub - Creating an Unassigned Task,"Your teams are in the field. When you have a task to assign, you call one of your colleagues to find out who can handle it and when. How can you save time and propose an unassigned task to be carried out without having to include it in the work schedule? How can you create this task if you are not at the office in front of your PC? My staff members in the field already use StaffHub. I make the work schedule available to them and possibly add notes about their activities. In this case, I noticed that at one of the locations managed by my team, they forgot to set up one of the rooms. I would like to let the team on site know about my concern. I am out of the office and will open the StaffHub application on my mobile device. On the home page of the application, I go to the block of tasks. I decide to add a new task. I give the task a name. And possibly a deadline. In my case, I will keep today as it is fairly urgent. A detailed description. I may be able to support my request with an attachment, such as an image. What is important here is to leave “Anyone” for the task assignment. This allows me to inform everyone. The advantage is that I don’t have to look up who is available today look after this task.

Top tips for working in Excel Online Part 1,"When your Excel Online worksheet is a crowd of data,changing the formatting of numbers and textscan help make information stand out.Let’s look at three ways to make this worksheet easier to read with formatting.One way is to change either text or number in a cell look.By changing font style, size or color.Column or row titles are a great place for this.Select the cells you want to change and use the font options on the “Home” tab.Here I made the column Bold and changed the font.And then the font size.My column titles pop up even more with different background and text colors.I click “Fill color” and choose this blue color.Then I click “Font color” and choose this white color.Another way to format information in Excel Onlineis with text alignment. In my worksheet, I notice that some of the cells are aligned to the rightand others to the left.My worksheet will look better and read more clearly if all my cells are aligned in the same way. I select all the columns in my spreadsheetand click “Align text left”.The text in one of my column titles is a little long,some of the text is cut off.To make the text easier to read, I select this cell and click “Wrap text”. The text wraps so the entire column title is now visible.A third way to help add clarity and readability to your worksheetis by formatting the way the numbers appears.This column has dates that use different format. I want them all to look the sameso I select the column and on the “Home” tab, I click “Number format”. I’d like my dates to includes the week day so I click “Long date”. I can also change the way currency is shown.I select the “Sales Amount” column, click “Number Format”and click “Currency”.I’m done making changes to my worksheetbut I don’t need to manually save it.Excel Online saves automatically all the changes I make.",excel onlin worksheet crowd datachang format number textscan help make inform stand outlet look three way make worksheet easier read formattingon way chang either text number cell lookbi chang font style size colorcolumn row titl great place thisselect cell want chang use font option home tabher made column bold chang fontand font sizemi column titl pop even differ background text colorsi click fill color choos blue colorthen click font color choos white coloranoth way format inform excel onlinei text align worksheet notic cell align rightand other leftmi worksheet look better read clearli cell align way select column spreadsheetand click align text leftth text one column titl littl longsom text cut offto make text easier read select cell click wrap text text wrap entir column titl visiblea third way help add clariti readabl worksheeti format way number appearsthi column date use differ format want look sameso select column home tab click number format id like date includ week day click long date also chang way currenc showni select sale amount column click number formatand click currencyim done make chang worksheetbut dont need manual save itexcel onlin save automat chang make
Top tips for working in Excel Online Part 2,"Let’s look at three ways to add numbers in my company sales spreadsheet.Perhaps the easiest way is to select a set of numbers in rows or columns,and look at the sum of those numbers down here on the status bar.Another way to add numbersin multiple rows or columnsis to use “AutoSum” on the “home” tab.I select the first empty cells to the right of my rows data.I click “AutoSum”.Don’t worry if you get a column of hashtag symbols,that just means your column is too narrow for your set of numbers.Double click the right border of your column, to expand the width.And the cells numbers will appear. I add a title for this new column.I can do the same thing to get my quarterly totals. I select the first empty cells below each of my columnsand click “AutoSum”.I add a title for this new row of numbers.The nice thing about AutoSum is that it will recalculate if you change numbers.AutoSum works the best, when you’re working with only sequential numbers,no blank cells or text.If you need to add rows or columns containing blank or text cells, create a formula with the “Sum” function.A “Sum” function can add numbers whether the cells were in a sequential rangeor just a bunch of individual unconnected cells.I want to add these numbers, plus the number in this cell.In an empty cell, I type the equal sign,“Sum” and an opening parenthesis,then I select this cell and drag my selection to this cell.To add to this formula, I type a comma,select the other celland then type a closing parenthesis.The “Sum” function adds all the numbers in a range of cells and the individual cell I selected. And just like the other sum, if any of the cells change,the sum function is updated automatically.",let look three way add number compani sale spreadsheetperhap easiest way select set number row columnsand look sum number statu baranoth way add numbersin multipl row columnsi use autosum home tabi select first empti cell right row datai click autosumdont worri get column hashtag symbolsthat mean column narrow set numbersdoubl click right border column expand widthand cell number appear add titl new columni thing get quarterli total select first empti cell columnsand click autosumi add titl new row numbersth nice thing autosum recalcul chang numbersautosum work best your work sequenti numbersno blank cell textif need add row column contain blank text cell creat formula sum functiona sum function add number whether cell sequenti rangeor bunch individu unconnect cellsi want add number plu number cellin empti cell type equal signsum open parenthesisthen select cell drag select cellto add formula type commaselect celland type close parenthesisth sum function add number rang cell individu cell select like sum cell changeth sum function updat automat

First of all, we have to select a name. We will just call it ""Company 01"". Then the business type.Maybe, we sell guided tours across the city. Then we click on Continue.Now it will create a company page on Bookings. We just have to wait a few seconds.Of course, it can take a few seconds. After, it will be able, as we saw previously on the PowerPoint, to add the different information that we need for the customer to make their reservations better, and we will also be able to manage our staff.To put their information and their availability: When are our employees available and when can we put  tasks for them? So we are now on the Company 01 page on Bookings. To begin with, let's go on the left.We have different tabs: Business information on the bottom left. Let's click on this.Right here, we have a lot of information to add. The business name: ""Company 01"", no problem with this. The business address: Let's say, Street of Shops.The business phone: we can put our business phone quickly.And also ""Send customer replies to"". Here, we will have to put a professional email address. All of the replies from the customers will go directly to this address. Let's put a false email address.The website URL, if we have one. The privacy policy URL and the terms and conditions as well. The business type: We already added the info. And the currency that will be used on the booking page. So we have a lot of different currencies.Let's keep the dollar.The business logo: Let's click on Change. We have Upload new logo, on the right.I can click on the one I want for the booking logo. If I need to crop the logo, I can add colors to the background if I don't want to crop it, maybe red, etc. Here it's the perfect size, but just in case.Then I click on Save. The logo will appear on the left. On the right, we have to add the business hours. It begins on Sunday to Saturday. Sunday and Saturday are closed by default, but if you want we can open those different dates.After that, we have all the days of the week from 8 AM to 5 PM. I can change this for every day.I can say that maybe on Mondays we do not work. I click on the little cross Remove this time slot. But let's say on Saturdays we work from 8 AM to 4 PM.When everything is OK, we can click on the top left on Save to save the different information about our business.So when it is saved, we can go on the left on the Staff tab. The only staff member to be available will be me, the creator of this Bookings page. But I can click on Add staff.To begin with, I will choose the color for the staff member, let's say orange. His initials, TD. I can add someone, I can just put some letters and I will find people, let's say Amaury.As you can see, I put it TD at first. I choose Amaury and then the initials change automatically. His email address, his phone number if I want to, and if he is a viewer, an administrator or a guest. Administrators can edit all settings, add and remove staffand create, edit and delete bookings. Viewers can see all the bookings on the calendar but they can't edit or delete them. Guests can be assigned to bookings but they can't open the booking mailbox.Let's say he is a viewer because he can access the calendar. He can't edit or delete anything but he has access to it.I can choose if I want to send him an email notification for the different information that will be right here.On the right, I have his availability. Events on Office 365 calendar affect availability. So will the events on his own calendar affect his availability on Bookings? Yes, or no, if I want to check it or not.Do I use the business hours for his availability? Yes or no. If I uncheck it, I can just change his availability. Let's say on Tuesdays, he does not work, but from Wednesday to Saturday he works the whole day, every time.On Saturdays, he will work after the closing time. Now I can click on Save on the top left.Let's do another one quickly to have some members in the staff,. Let's add Pierre this time. Once again, the color, phone number, viewer, email notification, does events affect his availability, and do I use the business hours. Well, no, I will change some hours quickly.Let's click on Save once again. Now we have staff members, so I can go on the left, I will have a few more possibilities. To begin with let's go to Services.What can I do for customers? Let's add a service.The service name: Let's say ""Guided tour (Short)"".Description : ""The shortest guided tout available"".The location: I put ""Street"" and as you can see we have different streets.The duration: Days, hours and minutes. Maybe it's for 2 hours. Do we have a buffer time? The buffer time is, maybe, we have 15 minutes before and after this time that people can't book because we have to make some preparation, etc.The price: Fixed price, starting at something, hourly price, free, price varies, call us to know, price is not set. Let's say fixed price at $60. Then the notes, which are internal only, if you need internal notes for this.Then we have the Custom fields. If we click on Modify, we can see the customer email, phone number, address and notes. Are they required or not? I can click on the one I want, maybe the phone number is required, maybe not.I can add a question on the top, either text question or dropdown question. Let's say, dropdown question: ""Will you be more than 5 people?""Then we put ""Yes"" or ""No"" and we save. We can say if it is required or not. Let's click on OK.Now we can add a reminder. The default reminder is one day before, but I can add an email reminder,let's say one hour to the customer, the staff or the attendees.""Do not forget the guided tour in 1 hour.""Then we have the publishing options: Show this service on the booking page. Yes, I want to. And the online scheduling options. We can use the default scheduling policy or we can change it. Sow available times in increments of 30 minutes or more.The minimum lead time for booking cancellation in hours, 24 hours for example. And the maximum lead time, so maximum number of days in advance that a booking can be made. Do I want an email notification about this? For the business, not for the customer.And do we allow the customers to choose a specific staff member for their guided tour. Let's click on Save. Let's create another one quickly. Service name: ""Guided tour (long)"".Location, hours, let's say 5 hours.The price: Fixed price, the custom fields, etc. When everything is done, I can click on Save. Now we have 2 services available for the customers.On the left, we have the Customers tab. We will find all the different customers that already booked things with us or I can create new customers myself. First name, last name, email, display as something,phone, instant messaging, work phone, address, other information or not. If a customer books something on this page, they will automatically appear in this Customers tab.Then we have the Booking page. For now, it is not published. Customer data usage consent: Show a personal data collection and usage consent toggle along with a message on my booking page? Yes or no. The scheduling policy: The time increments, etc.The email notifications for the business; and do we allow customers to choose a specific staff member? On the right, I can customize my page: The color theme, let's say orange or green because its Bookings, do we display our logo?And if I want to change some region settings. I can now save and publish this page. I can now share it. So I can copy the link and put it on Facebook, Twitter, and send it by mail. Let's copy it and we will open it after.The calendar tab. For now there is nothing but it's the Office 365 calendar for everybody, but for the company there is nothing for now. On the homepage, we have some possibilities: Customize our booking page, set our business hours, create our first booking...Things that I've already done, but these are quick access to it. We also have the booking activities on 30 days: The bookings made, the estimated revenue and the customers that are booked right now.Let's open the link I copied a few seconds ago. I open it on the side and I will put it on the screen in a few seconds.Here is what customers will see.We have the initial consult which was the test service that was on the booking page. It's nothing but we have the guided tour (long or short). Let's click on ""short"" to begin with.Then we have to select the time. The calendar is loading. Let's say I want it for Tuesday, 26. I click on it, and I want it at 1:00 PM, and because I authorized it,as a customer I can choose the staff member that I want on this time. Maybe I want Oliver Lodge to be the tour guide.After it, I have to add my details: The name, Laurent, my email address, my phone number, my real address and if I have any special requests.So let's just add some ""test test test"" to see what it will look like. We also have Provide additional information. ""Will you be more than 5 people?"" Yes, or no. I click on ""yes"" and then I click on Book.I forgot to select time and the phone number quickly. Then I can click on Book.It will take a few seconds for the booking to be made, but as you can guess just after it, the information will go to the email address of the business I put on my booking page. So I will receive notification for the booking and the information of this customer.As you can see, you will get a confirmation message in email shortly. It's a fake email address so I won't receive it. I'm back on this page, I can reschedule, cancel booking or make a new booking. If I click on New booking and then Guided tour (long),I can select the date, the time and the staff member. But because I didn't add the ""Will you be more than 5 people?"" object, it is not here, but I can still book the long guided tour.Then I will have the information about this customer. I will take a few minutes, but it will appear at one moment or another. Maybe if we go on the 26 to check,as you can see ""Oliver Lodge, guided tour (short) with Laurent.It appears right here. In the Customers tab, I have Laurent with all his information. Back to our PowerPoint, we saw that we had to add our company's information: Information, logo, opening hours.We had to save our employees details, to choose on employees availability, the services: The length, the price, the staff affectation and the final phase was to connect our reservation page to our Facebook,to manage notifications, to personalize our theme, and to publish it. I will find reservations in the calendar. So we receive booking confirmations by email directly in our agenda and I can add reservations manually in the calendar.I can also add holidays or days off and I can follow my activity. From the customer's view, I can enjoy a quick and simple alternative to the usual reservation: Easy access via Internet to select the services,choose the date, do you want a specific employee? What time would you like?And the customer's info, the schedule confirmation by email and the reminder by email.I can also follow my activities on my smartphone and I can manage my company without a sweat.Now we will check the training portal and if you have any questions, we will see about it. On the training portal, you will find the Learning Paths which are different training sessions in the same context.Let's say we want to know more about Outlook. I will find the different learning paths about Outlook. Inside, I will have different courses that talk about Outlook.In Courses, I will find different courses that I can register to. Let's say I want to know more about Bookings.I click on it, and on the right, if there is any available session I will find them and I will be able to click on Register to be on this training session. The Tutorials are very short videos from 50 seconds to 5 minutes. You have a lot of them.You want to know more about Planner, we have 7 videos about Planner and how to use it. 2 minutes, nearly 3 minutes, 1 minute, etc. It is very short and it goes directly to the goals that you want you want.You want to know more about creating compartments to organize tasks, those videos will not talk about anything else than what's in the title. The Use Case Scenarios, like the Tutorials, are very short videos not about a specific software but about a subject.The first one: ""Organize your next team meeting"". We are not talking about any software here but the videos will talk about the different software you can use to organize you next team meeting. Finally, we have on the top right if you click on your name, My dashboard.In the dashboard you find all the information about yourself on the training sessions: The different Courses you have taken, the Learning Paths, the training Sessions in which you are registered and if you have shared anything. Here in the ""You are registered to x Session"",you will find today's training session about Bookings. After this session, you will be able to go in this section and to evaluate this session. It's not mandatory but if you answer this little evaluationyou can say everything about this course, good things, not-so-good things, anything you want. It is for us to be better in what are we do. Everything you say will be taken into consideration.If you have any questions, I'm listening. Tell me if you want to know more about Bookings? Do you have any questions? No I think that's pretty straightforward, the only question I have would be: You said the video was going to be recorded, have we got an email copy about that?Not for now, you will not receive an email with it, but you will find it on the MOOC on the Bookings Training Session section. You'll find those videos on the bottom right, but not now.We have a little time to process it before it. If everything is good for you, I thank you for being here today and for your participation.Make the best use of what you have learned. I hope to see you on another training session and have a good day.",today go see microsoft book onlin book process made easi begin cours last 30 minut first microsoft book manag compani informationso

Skype VS Teams,"Hello, everyone. I'm Thomas and welcome to this webinar about Skype VS Teams. So let's begin right now.Before we begin, as you may have noticed your microphones are muted in order not to have any background noise on this webinar. Also remember to stay active on your computer or else your computer will go stand-by mode and you'd be disconnected from the session.Today we have 30 minutes. So why Teams has the same possibilities as Skype. Also, the benefits of using Teams.Then we will be comparing the audio, video and meeting functionalities.How to make the transition from Skype to Teams easier and in the end a little conclusion. The goals for today are to identify the similarities and differences between those two softwares and how to be prepared for the transition from Skype to Teams.So we have Skype and we have Teams. What are Skype and Teams? Why does Teams have the same functionalities as Skype? What will happen to Skype?And the updates and evolutions possible. To begin with, what are Skype and Teams. Skype is a communication chat, audio and video call online meeting application. Teams is more is a more compressive tool, which was created when Microsoftwanted to simplify the access to the Office 365 functionalities that where richer every day.So the idea is to give to the user an application in which it will be possible to choose apps and to centralize the messages and documents. Why does Teams have the same functionalities as Skype?So still in the idea of simplification, Teams will have Skype's functionalities.Users will have a unique space for conversations, contacts, files and will be able to work at maximum capacity. What will happen to Skype? The different announcements about Skype are a bit alarmist. Skype will not disappear in a matter of days. You don't after users that Skype will disappear.Outside of Office 365, Microsoft now gives a Skype server 2019 for companies that want Skype on promise with dedicated servers.Updates and evolutions? With the office 365 version, there won't be any maintenance or updates and all the efforts will now go to Teams.Even if Teams is not yet seen as reliable or innovative, it will soon be. As a proof, the fact that certain functions now exist in Teams and not in Skype. For example, blurred backgrounds on live calls.So on Skype and Teams, what are the differences? On Skype and on Teams, we have the instant messaging, the availability status indicator, the audio and video call, the online meeting, the meeting planification, the SIP Telephonyand the large scale meetings. But on Teams, we will have a bit more things. So we will have a collaborative space, the discussion channels, the documented storage, the integrated calendar, the application launcherand the ability to edit and co-edit documents.So, we have the communication part in which Skype is already doing a good job for which Teams has the same possibilities. And we will have the collaboration part in which Teams is better than Skype because it has more possibilities, more functionalities.The benefits of using Teams: we have the exchange between teams, the collaborative tools,the Office 365 applications' integration, the third-party applications' integration,the workspace personalization,the access to different tenants and also a single login to all of our tools and documents.I can see that there are a lot of people that don't have any sound. If anyone has sound can you tell me in the chat box on the top of the screen or else we will continue the training session.So I can see that a lot of people have sound, so just some people have problems, so we will go on and they will have the little recording of the streaming session. So it will be OK. So now we are going to compare Skype and Teams.So the things that are already on Skype, we will see them directly on Teams. I'm going to put Teams on the screen.So we are right here on Teams. I will go on the Teams tab on the left so we will begin freshly direction Teams.Just the time for it to load and we will see it in a few seconds.So we have the Teams tab. It is where the collaborative work is going to happen, but also the communication. We want to know here what are the differences on functionalities that are the same on Skype and Teams.We are going to see it right now by clicking on the left on the chat tab. The chat tab is going to be for the instant messaging. So to begin with, as you can see on the top, we have two sorts of tabs. We have the recent tab with all recent the conversations.and with the three little dots, I can add a contact to this group. So I can click on it, I choose someone which I have as a contact, like Amaury. I click on ""add"" and then, as you can see, Amaury is now in my web contacts. But alsosome things that I can do: at the bottom, you can see ""create a new contact group"".So I choose a name, let's say ""webinar group"".I click on ""create"".And now I have, as you can see on the left, right here, webinar group. Once again, I can click on ""options"", ""add a contact to this group"". I choose someone an I can add him directly into this group and, of course, like it's on Skype. I have my different groups, my different people. I cantalk to all of them, like you used to do on Skype. Let's go on, on the instant messaging. What can we do in here?Let's go with Pierre. As you may know, I can send simple message. Once again, I'm going to say ""hello"" to Pierre.But on the bottom I will have a few more possibilities than on Skype.To begin with, I have the possibility to format my text. I can put it in bold, in italics, underline it. But a few more possibilities to highlight, change the font color, the font size, etc. Like a little text paragraph.Of course I can attach different documents from my OneDrive or even uploaded from my computer like I used to do before. As you know, I have the little emojis that are available and the little GIF. The GIF, I can just click on it and different GIFs will appear.I can choose one of them to send it directly.I have the stickers, which are little images.And lastly I have schedule a meeting. If I click on ""schedule a meeting"", as you can see, a new window will appear. We are going to talk about the this window a bit further into the training session, but at least you know it's here.Then we have the three little dots, the messaging extension, and if I click on I can add different little applications directly to my conversation: news, places, stocks, weather, Wikipedia search and also YouTube.And, I can create my messaging to be a little more structured than on Skype. It will not simply be different sentences. Now I can put it in bold, highlight, change font, etc. So I can really do a little text rather thanjust sentences.Still, on the instant messaging, I will find back in the tab on the top, as you can see, the Files tab.I will find right here the different files that I have shared with Pierre. I can click on ""share"" from OneDrive or my computer and, right here, I will be able to share documents with Pierre and I will find them all here. On Skype, we did not have thisto find back the documents, while here we can. It will be a little files library with my colleagues and co-workers. Of course, with the little plus button at the top I can add a new tab from different applications: Excel, OneNote, PDF,Power BI, etc. We will have the ability, into the conversation, to have those different applications directly in it. So no need to talk on Teams and then go online and on applications, then share documents. No, I can just go directly into the instant messaging on Teams and work from here.I won't have to use 3, 4, 5 different applications to work with my colleagues. I can go on Teams to do all of this directly.But also aside from the instant messaging, I will have the possibility on the top right, as you can see, to call my colleagues, my coworkers. So the audio call and so I can, as you may know, share my screen. If I call here, for example,so I click on it and it takes a few seconds to load, as you can see on the bottom, I can use the little ""share"" button and they have the three little dots that we will see a bit later during the training session as well. Now let's go directly into the ""meetings"" tabon the left.So, in the ""meetings"" tab, first things first, we will find on the left all of the different meetings that I have scheduled. They are scheduled on Teams or even on Outlook. I will be able to find all of my Outlook meetings directly into Teams.So it will be all on the left and if I click on it, I will find those meetings information, so the day, the hour etc. But I can find the different attendees and also the different information that I put in it, like maybe in which room is the meeting, etc.I can change the views of my calendar. Right here, it's today. But if I click on the three little lines on the left for the agenda view,as you can see we have for the whole month: today, tomorrow, Friday, etc.Right here on the right, on the information pages, I will have the possibility to chat with the participants. So it will open a conversation, cancel the meeting if I'm the organizer. But if I'm not, if I'm an attendee, I will be able to accept it, put it on hold or evensay I won't be present.We have the little links on the bottom. If I click on it, I will join these Teams meetings via Teams online. So it will be like you used to do on Skype when you sent links and you'll be able to click on them to access the meeting. On the top right, we have ""Join"".I will be able with this button to join the meeting directly on Teams being the software or the application.Now, I want to create, to schedule a new meeting. I will click on the bottom left,""Schedule a meeting"". First of all, the title. Let's say, customer meeting.The location will be on Microsoft Teams meeting, so directly into Teams, or I can see it will be in room 1 or 4, for example.When does it start and end? At which hour for the beginning and the end? I have the same scheduling assistant that I used to have on Outlook. So let's invite Amaury, Pierre and then I click on the scheduling assistant and I will find back the scheduling assistantlike in Outlook, but directly into Teams once again.Then I can change the time zone, as you can see, but also, on the bottom, I can add details with the same formatting possible as we saw just before on the instant messaging.On the right, we have ""select the channel to meeting"". So the channel, we have all of the different Teams channel right here. I can click, for example, on ""call for tenders"" and they have the general channel. I can select it and you'll understand just after why I did it.And as you know, I can invite some people right here.So let's just put it in a business team right here.Share once again and maybe Amaury, well Paul. Perfect. I have Paul and Pierre in my meeting in the business team general. Let's schedule this meeting.It's now loading and automatically I'm back in the Teams tab, as you can see on the left, and on the top I have business team and the general channel. As you can see right here, my meeting that I've just created, the customer meeting is now directly integrated into this team.So I can and everybody in this channel, this team will be able to do it as well, I can just click on itand I will have ""chat with the participants"", but it will bring me back into the same channel as I was a few seconds ago, and I can click on ""join"". I click on ""join"".I'm able to activate my video feed or audio feed and I can click on ""Join Now"".I'm connecting to the meeting.And on the bottom, once again audio, video call and I have the ""share tray"". In the share tray, I be able to share my screen, 1 or 2, but also my windows.I can also share my PowerPoints, like I used to do on Skype, and on the right we have the White Board. The White Board, which is not directly from Skype but by 3N by envision, will be a white board quite similar to what we used to have on Skype butwith a few more possibilities, like the presenter mode that will allow us to add information into the board, but automatically, the attendees that are looking at the white board as well, will follow what I do. What I'm trying to say is that, let's say I'm going far rightto add some images, automatically their screen will follow my mouse on the far right.Also I have the three little dots in which we find the keypad. So I think you know about the keypad and how to use it.Then we have the ""start recording"" to record the meeting, the call. I can turn off incoming videos. I don't want to see people's houses or faces while we are in a meeting, I can just turn off the incoming video. Another possibility that we have, but I don't have it right here because Idon't use the webcam, is that I can blur the video feed from me. Let's say I'm at home, I'm doing a meeting with my colleagues, but I don't want them to see whatever is behind me: my house, my family etc. So I can blur the background. They will only see meand the background will be blurred.On the top right, I have the possibility to take notes.Also to talk with a different participant in an instant messaging way,to see the different attendees but also to invite people. And on the top right, I can change the audio devices, the speakers, the microphone and the camera.So, now that you have seen this, one little thing that you will have on the top roght, just next to your picture. You will be able to change your tenants. You'll be able to use Teams on different tenants and so you will haveyour tenants right here on the top, between ""search for"" or ""type a command"" and your picture, you have your tenants and just by clicking on it, you have a list of all of the tenants that you have access to. So you click on one of them and Teams will reload to show the teams of the new tenantwith other teams and other channels, etc. Now, let's go back to our PowerPoint.Now that we've seen the things that are the same on Skype and Teams, let's talk about how to make the transition easier for users.So, we have 3 steps: the communication, the cohabitation and decision making.To begin with, the admin activates the invitation to use Teams, so that the different users will receive an invitation to start use Teams. Just after it, Teams is open to the users. Now, let's go to the cohabitationIn the middle of it, we will have the adoption. At any given moment, users will have or will want to adopt Teams and they will have the Teams training to know how to use it. Then, in the decision making we will have, of course, the decision period.So the idea here is to let the users choose which tools they want to communicate, for what use, at any given moment. You don't want to start by saying: ""You do not have Skype anymore, let's go to Teams"". No. They need to have a transition period.So if Teams is not yet deployed in your company, that can be a good start to use it as a collaborative tool. Give a period of some weeks or even months to your users to use Teams at the same time as Skype. Some users will prefer to use Teams and will influence others to use Teams.Step by step, Teams will take the upper hand, even more if it's used as a collaborative tool. After this given time, you'll have to make a choice: let the 2 applications and give more time to the users if you think they need it; or take out Skype after you have warned the users about it and of course you can choose toend Skype. So the cohabitation, the extension period or Skype Deactivations are the three steps and you'll have to communicate on it for the users to know what will happen to Skype, when they will start to use Teams, etc.So, little conclusion now. First of all, you have time: Skype will not disappear today, you have time to make the transition between Skype and Teams.Of course, don't rush your users or else they will not want to start using Teams if you rush them to it. Let them take time, too. Teams takes the purpose of the perfect collaborative tool: it's complete and intuitive. You also havesome Microsoft resources links that I will share with you directly in the chat. So to help with the transition, the Teams roadmap and the Q&A on Skype to Teams. I will send you those little links into the chat. The chat even the top of the screen, the secondbubble from the left.So the first one, help with transition.Then we have the second one, the Teams roadmap.And lastly we have the Q&A on Skype to Teams.So Q&A Skype/Teams.And lastly, on the MOOC, you'll have courses about Teams and dedicated tutorials.The different Skype and team tutorials, you have them on the screen right now: the different possibilities or to manage your availability and see your coworkers' status, create a contact group, meeting from Outlook, record a meeting, create a live event, invite external people to a meeting, share your screen during a meeting,retrieve information from a meeting, instant messaging with a contact, add a contact to acontact group, and change your peripheral during a meeting. But we have one last thing: the modern workplace cloudworkshop. I'm going to put it right now on screen.So just a few seconds for me to load it on the side and put it on screen just after.So in March, and you'll se in on the screen in a few seconds, you'll have a workshop about, as you can see on the brief overview and who should attend. This workshop is aimed at organization, looking for efficient meansto generate adoption and stimulate greater use of Microsoft 365. When is it? On March, 7th 2019, in London, Westminster Meeting room, Microsoft, 2 Kingdom St. and is from 9:30 AM.And the second part starts at 12 PM.So I will send you this as a link because you can, if you want, register to it to participate. So I will send the link in the chat as well. And so I will call it UK workshop.Right here, so by clicking on this link you can register to this workshop in London.So now if you have any question about everything that we saw today, you can write it directly into the chat. We will take all of those questions, and then we will have in a while shortly a Q&A that will be availablefor you with all of the questions that you've asked and so you'll be able to find back all of the answers to these questions directly in the Q&A.So I will let you the time to write your different questions. Oonce again, you'll find the answers back in the Q&A. I thank you for being here today on this webinar. Make the best use of what you've learned.Have a good day and I hope to see you on another training session.I let you have time to write the different questions, and I will put back the links once again because some people did not find them back, so I will put the different links into the chat.You should have different things. Once again, thank you for being here. I wish you a good day.

Run effective meetings with Teams,"Welcome everyone to this training sessionon how to run effective meetings on Teams.So, of course, before we begin, we have some recommendation.So, turn off the call waiting.Or else, the hold music could be heard by all participants.Put your phone in mute mode, via the Mute Mic button and,of course, keep your screen active at all times.If you do not touch your PC for a long time,it goes on standby modeand then you'll be automatically disconnected from the session.So today, we have 45 minutes to see different things.To begin with, we'll see how to schedule a meeting.Then we'll see about the Instant meeting, how to Join a meeting,what can we do during a meeting and then the Teams add-in.The objectives today are to learn different ways to create meetingsand how to run the most effective meetingsby using all the tools available.So, I'm going to put Teams on the screen...Right here. So, we are on Teams, we have the little tab on the left.Our different teams are right here, and of course,the view window is on the right.So, first thing you want to do is go in the Meeting tab on the left.In the Meeting tab, I will find right heremy different schedule for the day.As you can see, I have different meetings right here,but on the top right I can change the view right here.I can put it on the agenda view, so I have, as you can see today,tomorrow, Wednesday, etc.And if I go back and then I click on it, I have the day view,which we already saw previously.On the right, I have the possibility to Accept or Declinedifferent meetings.As you can see right here, I can Accept it.Put a Tentative,maybe I would be here or maybe not and I can decline it.Of course, Tentative is when I'm not sure about my different schedules,so I have to check beforehand and then I put tentative in case of,and after it, well, I click on Accept to say that I am available,or not, if I click on Decline.Also right here, you'll see all of the different informationabout the meeting.Of course, right here, we do not have a lot of information,but you will be able to find the phone number,maybe there is a specific link and more information,maybe if you had to bring some things, or location, etc.So now, we are going to click on the bottom lefton Schedule a Meeting.On Schedule a Meeting, we'll have many more possibilities.So to begin with, you have the title.So let's say, simple Team Meeting.Then the location, here we will be online on Teams.So, we're just going to leave Microsoft Teams Meeting,or maybe it's in another place.So, I can put, for example, Room 104.Then I will have to choose the date of this meeting.So let's say tomorrow and then at what time, say 4 p.m.until 5 p.m.Of course, I have the Scheduling Assistant.Scheduling assistant, if I invite some people,so let's add Steven, for example.I can see Steven is scheduled.And so right here, he has no problem with the specific schedule,but if he has problems, as you can see right here,we have different blocks that show there is something at this moment.I can Go Back, I can Close it or I can Schedule the Meeting.Let's go back.Then right here, I can add the details about this meeting.Do not forget about Project Alpha.Once again, on the right, I can invite some people.So if I write some name, for example, as you can see Paul.And on the top right, I can select a channel to meet him.So as I said before, we can do an online meetingdirectly on Teams, but I can select a specific channelin which we'll store the different documents,different information, etc.So I just have to click on it, I have my different Teams right here.Let's go on Alpha Project,and right here we have Alpha 1 and if I choose Alpha 1,as you can see now, we have the channel right here.But Steven was right here and not anymore.It's because we have selected a specific channel,which means that maybe Steven is not part of this channel.So we have to invite him back.This is Steven, and as you can see, Steven is not a member of this channel.So I can't invite him because it's a private channel.But as you can see, Laurent and Philippe are members,so I can invite them, if I want to, of course.Right here.So, whenever I want, I can just click on Scheduleand now I will be automatically back.As you can see on the top, Alpha Project, Alpha 1.And on the bottom right here, I have Amaury,which is my demonstration accountwith little details, don’t forget about Project Alphaand the meeting, Team Meeting I added just before.And if I want to, of course, I can put some Likes,I can Save this message, and also, I can edit itbecause I am the author.Under it, we have Reply.As on any Team current session, I can just add replies to it.We have the same functionalities and optionsthat they normally have on any Teams conversation.So now if I want, I can click on Team Meeting right hereand I will find back all of the different information.I can join this meeting, I can chat with the participants,but I'm already on the good channel so it will only bring me back to it.I can Cancel it, because I'm the organiser,add little details, and, of course, right here we have the link,the link to access this Team Meeting.And on the right, I have the different attendees and, of course,the Alpha Project, which is the name of the team,is also in attendees because everybody in the Alpha Project channelcan access my meeting.I can edit on the right if I want, but I can also close it.So now we also have, if I put Outlook on the screen,the option to create Teams meeting directly on to Outlook.So I just have to click, as you can see on the top,new Teams meeting,just have to wait a few seconds for it to open.As you can see, I have a little link directly into my meeting messageSo as you can see, I can join the Microsoft Teams meeting right hereby clicking on it, and, of course, when I send this message,each of my attendees will receive it with a little link,and if they click on the link, they will be directed into my meeting.And if I create any meeting on Outlook, which I will do right here,let's call it Test Teams,Save and Close.If I go back on Teams on the meeting tab,then I guess, on Thursday,as you can see, we have Test Teams right here.And of course, it's the Outlook meeting that I've just created.And as a Team Meeting tomorrow on 104,if I go back on Outlook,you can find it right here, Team Meeting, room 104.So whenever I create a meeting on Teams, it will be on Outlookand whenever I create a meeting on Outlookit will be automatically on Teams.Now we're going to talk about another subject.So, let's go back on the Teams tab.So...We are going to find right herethe option to create an instant meeting.So how do we create an instant meeting?I'm right here on Alpha 1, I have multiple possibilities.First one, I'm here, on a channel and at the bottomI will have right here a little button, Meet now.Let's click on it.I can add the subject.So let's say, important.And let's say...Johnson Project.I can click on Meet now to create an instant meeting,but we'll see this afterwards.I can Turn off or Turn on my camera if I have oneand I can Schedule a meeting.If I click on Schedule a meeting, as you can see,I have the same window as I had before.I can schedule a normal meeting.But it’s not what we want.So let's go back on it.Let's just call it Project 1and if we can click on Meet now,it will create an instant meeting.We are going to talk about the instant meetinga bit later in this session.So let's close it for now.After it, how to create another instant meeting is with,let’s go back on the top, as you can see Laurent, right here.If I put my mouse on his picture, I will have a little popup.In this popup, I have right here, Audio Calland Audio Call is an instant meeting, but with only one person.If I click on it, as you can see, I'm calling her.And of course, it is not available for now.I'm on the Chat tab as you can see on the top left of the screen,so Chat tab.Once again, I have Laurent right here,and on the bottom, on the top right,we have the possibility to do another audio call.And of course, as it was on the little popup with the picture,I click an Audio Call and once again I'm calling him.So it's another instant meeting.Of course, it's also possible to do it from the mobile device.We are going to see it on the PowerPoint presentationa bit later in the session.But yes, it's possible from the mobile deviceto also create an Instant Meeting.Now, we want to know how to join different meetings.In Teams, on the Meeting tab, of course,I would find all of my different meetingsand if I want to, I can join them.As you can see, I'm on Team Meeting, which is tomorrow.And on the top right, I have the Join button.So Join button, if I click on it, as you can see, I have to choosemy audio and video settings, which we'll doa bit later on this session and I will be able to join this meeting.But we have many more possibilities to do that.As you saw on Outlook, let's go back on it.On Outlook, I have, for example, Team Meeting, right here.And if I open it, automatically, I will have, as you can see right here,join Microsoft Teams meeting.And if I click on it, it will open.I can do it right now.I'll put it on the screen in a few seconds as well.Let's not leave Outlook on the screen.Okay, I am putting it on my main screen right now...Right here.And it's asking me if I want to download a Windows application,if I want to stay on the web to join this meetingand I just have to choose.Either I use the Microsoft app or I want to go directly online.And of course, everybody would be able to do that.So of course, once again, it's a possibility from mobile devicesto be directly on Teams.You click on your meeting, you click on Join the meetingand you'll be on the audio and video feed, of course.If there is any number or participant code to this meeting,you can use your mobile device, or even let's say, Skypeor let’s say Teams to join the audio as well.It's possible with the mobile devices as a phoneand not as a little computer in your pocket to join the meeting.But there is a difference between Meeting and Call.When you call someone, it's a private conversation.It's between you and another person.But when you are in a meeting, you have multiple people in it.And as you can see, on the top right, you have the Join button because,well, the meeting, we have to join a meeting.And for a call, we just have to take or make a call.Be careful.It's possible to join a meeting on Teams with a phone call,but it's not possible to join a phone call on Teams with your mobile.It's, as you're on Teams or you are not, but for a simple call,you'll have to be directly on Teams.And of course, on Teams, it's possible to join a meetingwith different possibilities, different options.It's not mandatory to be directly on Teams.It can be on Outlook, it can be on your mobile device,or, of course, you can be on Teams.So now, what we want to see is what can we do during a meeting?So during a meeting, let's go on a meeting to see it.Let’s click on Join on the top right.So right here, once again, choose your audio and video settings.So I can click on Join Now to join the meeting.I can turn it off or turn on my camera, my mic and I can, of course,change my audio devices, my speaker, my microphoneand my camera once again.At the bottom of the screen, I can see other Join optionand with it as you can see, prevent echowhen there is already an active mic and speaker in the room,which means that I can talk with my mic,but also I can just turn off the audio.So I can hear everything with another mic and speakerand I will prevent the echo by turning it off right here.So now, let's click on Join Now to join this meeting.I'm in the meeting.Of course, I am alone because there is nobody elseon the meeting right now.But when there will be people, even before they arrive,I have multiple options.So let's go on the top right, to begin with.First thing, we have the full-screen mode.If I click on it, well, as you can see I'm now in full screen.I click on it once again.I have the, as you can see on the left,the little tabs from Teams that are back again.After it, we have the meeting notes.In the meeting notes, I would be able to findthe different notes that were taken during of before this meeting.And of course, if I want I can click on the little plus button right here.I can give a name to my notes, so Notes from the UK,for example.And I can put different information right here.But it's not the only thing.As you can see in the top, I have multiple options once again.I can put my text in bold, in italic, underline it,I can even highlight it, change the font colour,change the font size, I can add bulleted listsand numbered list.I can put some quotes, insert linksand I can change my paragraph.I can even add, let's go back on it, I can add picturesand I can add a table.As you can see, I add, quickly, a table.I can put different information in it.And once again, I can change the size, highlight, etc.With the three little dots right here, I can copy this thing,I can move my notes.So let's go on Test 2 to see it.Test 2 is the second, if I move it up, it would be the first.Like this, I can change the place of it all.And of course, I can delete itand copy the link to send this note,well, maybe I want to send it to someone.After it, I would have the show conversation button.In the show conversation button, I will find all of the little commentsthat were under my meeting on the channel.But also, I can find, as you can see, the notes, etc.So I can add a reply, of course, once again on the bottom,I can format it, attach some documents, add some emojis, add some gifs,add some stickers and, of course, little (places).So for example, let’s add quickly an emoji.I click on Send and it will be on the conversation feed on the right.But once again, if I go on the Teams tab,we are on the different teams and in the channel,I will find this little comment under my meeting.Now let's show the participants.I'm finding all the different participants right here.But I can also invite some people.Let's try to add Pierre, for example, I'm adding Pierre.Of course, he is not online for now, but I can add him.And so, I'd find the different personsthat are invited to this meetingand in the top right, I have the Copy Join info.So I can send a link to someone.And by clicking on it, you will be able to join this meeting.Then, of course, the settings of the device.Well, set your devices, camera device and as you can see,is a private viewing that allows the participants to move throughshared presentation on the right.And lastly, we have the info panel.But the info panel right here as you can see is disabledby policies from my company.So it would be on the Office 365 administrator to change this policy.So we saw everything on the top right.Now let's get back at the bottom.At the bottom, to begin with, we are about to turn off the cameraonce again, but also to turn on and turn off my microphone,put it in mute.After it, I will have the share tray.So the share tray, what can I do with it?To begin with, as you can see on the left, I am able to shareone of my screens, we have Screen 1 and Screen 2.If I click on one of it, well, it will show itto every attendee into this meeting.But I can also only share a single window.I don't want to share all of my desktopswith all of my information on it,well, a mistake is quickly made,so we never know.But if I just choose Window, I can just share, for example,a synopsis, a PowerPoint presentation, another window, as you can see,I have Skype right here and Teams will only show this windowand nothing else.If I close the window, if I minimise it,it will show nothing else, only a black screen.I can also on the right, right here,just share a PowerPoint presentation.So if I click on it, it's opening right now,so it will take a few seconds.As you can see, I have my PowerPoint presentation directly on the screenand everybody is seeing it right now at the same time.And at the bottom left, I can choose a slide.I can prevent the participantfrom moving through shared presentations on their own,just have to click on it.And then I have Stop presenting.So if I click on Stop presenting, well, to stop the presentation.Then on the right, we have two possibilities.Microsoft's whiteboard and Freehand by Invision.So I can't show them because I'm the only participant, this time.So it will automatically close, well, once again, before,I'm alone in this.So first of all, the Microsoft whiteboard is quite similarto what you are used to on Skype, for example.You'd be able to write whatever you want, to draw some linesin different colours, etc.But we also have the Freehand by Invision.So you have to sign up to Invision to use Freehand.Freehand, once again is quite similar to what you are used to on Skype,for example, once again, but also it will have a presenter mode.So what is a presenter mode on Freehand?Well, it will lock the video feed of all the participantsdirectly on your mouse.So let's say, you have a big whiteboard.On the top left, you are writing some information,so everybody can see it.But if you want to go on the far right, which is not even on the screen,well automatically the camera, let's say,the video feed of the attendees will follow your mouse across the pageon to the far right and they will see what and where you are writing.So it would really follow your mouse whenever it goeson the whiteboard and whatever you kind of write or add, or draw.Well, they will see it directly.They won't to have to search everywhere on the blank board to find it.Well, they will just follow your mouse whenever it goes.So, of course, during a team meeting, there are a lot of possibilitiesto add information to your presentation, but also to have better collaboration.But it's not all.We have another thing to show.Let's close this meeting.When we go on the Teams tab,right here you can see the Hello hall that is written just before.And as I said it is directly into the comments section.But if we go back to the meeting,let's Join it.Right here on the bottom right, we have more action.So one of the actions that we can't seebecause I do not have a video feedis the blur video feed, which means, let's say,you are, maybe, on the move, in a hotel or maybein another company working with some of the external colleagues.You don't want, during a meeting, to show what is happening beside you.So you can blur your own video feed, which means that automaticallyand in live, Teams will find you, let's say, the human bodyand also Teams will know what is not useful in this presentation.So everybody is going to see you, well as clear as waterso as on any video feed, but everything that is beside you will be blurredand you're going to see it on the PowerPoint presentation.We have the keypad. So, the keypad, well, you know what it's used for.You can compose different numbers and then call different people.But you need a special licence for this.You can start to record the video and audio feed.So by clicking on it, you would record everythingthat you can see on the screen right now and everything that you can hear.And then turn off incoming videos.Well, you don't want to see, let's say, you have ten peopleon Teams with video cameras on.You don't want to see everybody's faces.Well, you just turn off the incoming video and then you will only seewhat we have right now on the screen, but we have little bubblesforeveryone on this meeting.So we saw everything we wantedto see about what we can do during a Team meeting.But now, we have different Teams add-in.So we already saw Outlook.But there is one more, it's OneNote.On the top right here, we have different tabs.If I click on the Plus button, I will have another,well another possibility.As you can see, there are a lot of them, but on the top right,we have OneNote.So you may already know OneNote.It's an application in which you can take different notes.You can add it directly onto Teams and everybody in these teams,right now we are in this one, well, everybody in itwill be able to open this OneNoteand write anything they want in itand see everything that you have written, etc.It will be a collaborative tool directly in Teams.And of course, as you saw, there is a lot of applicationslike that in Teams.So now let's go back on the PowerPoint presentation.So, to schedule a meeting, we have as well the meeting tab.We can see in Agenda view or Day view,we have the New live event to do a live event.And it's like an accept, decline or maybe be here in a meeting.Of course, we also have different ways to communicate instantly.We have the phone calls, and also a little popup to find it.And also the Instant Meeting and as you can see on Teamson mobile devices, I can make a call just by selecting someone.To join meetings, well, from the meeting tab,from the mobile app but also from Outlook.As you can see on the mobile app, well,we will find all my different meetings, I just have to press Join to join that.And during meetings, we have different tools available.So is the sharing tray, we have the shared notebook,a record or blur network video streams and last chat.As you can see right here for the blurring,well we can see the trainer right here, but we can see whatever is behind him.We can see colours, we can see…Maybe a dog but we don't really know.If you have questions, do not hesitate.I will answer them.And if you don't have any questions, do not forget to go directlyinto the training platform to evaluate this session.Of course, I thank you for being here today.Put it to good use and I hope to see you in another training session.",welcom everyon train sessionon run effect meet teamsso cours begin recommendationso turn call waitingor els hold music could heard

Teams - Driving Teams Adoption,"Hello everyone. Welcome to this online session called ""Driving Teams Adoption"".My name is Dina and I will be your trainer today. To begin with, I would like to inform you that you have the possibility to ask questions during this live session via chat and you will also find the answers on our blog the following week.Be advised that this webinar is being recorded. You will have the opportunity to view it soon after on our MOOC platform.Before I start this presentation and in order to ensure that it runs smoothly, it is important to listen to the following instructions carefully. There are precisely two. The first one is:On your end all the participants microphones have been switched off. As you may all know, some of you may be working in an open space environment, so those are just cautionary measures to avoid unpredictable or unwanted background noise.The second and last one is: Remember to keep your computer screen active at all timesby wiggling the mouse every now and then.It is very important not to let your PC go into sleep mode as this will cause the interruption of the video and you will find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience here is that you will have to repeat the login steps all over again to get back in it.This is not going to be a training session. It is not from a technical point of view that we are going to address this session. Instead we are going to focus on a faster new approach to work while advocating or embodying best practices.Driving Teams Adoption is enabling the modern workplace with Office 365 and we're going to see this together.I don't think I have ever been to an online session that was so overbooked so I really want to thank you all for showing such enthusiasm about our product.During this 30-minute session here are the items we will be discussing: The introduction on ""Why change?""We'll see what the purpose of using Teams is, in what way and for whom.We'll find out how to organize that transformation and how to offer teams support.This will also be followed by a few good practices and your conclusion.The objectives here are to identify the steps to drive adoption and to turn towards a transition approach.Why change?The evolution of the way we work.Well before you,you have an idea of what past conditions looked like. Back then, employees spent the whole day in the office, behind a desk, with a landline telephone, getting up only to attend weekly meetingsin a conference room next door. Well, those days are long gone. These days,telework, nomadism, business travels are very common in companies. According to studies,employees are 4 times more likely to work in mobility today than in 2007.Today we can work, communicate and collaborate anytime from anywhere, and via many tools and especially with the software Microsoft Teams.What is collaboration? How do we work today?First, imagine yourself at the center of the company,in your own organization, being surrounded byall your colleagues.We can view different teams working on different projects internally.I want you to also imagine yourself floating over that structure, so you can have a panoramic viewon the whole company.Now, you're looking down and you can actually see every single colleague working and you understand their role in the company better. You see how you're exchanging on every projectand also that you are exchanging with outside personnel, external partners, subcontractors, vendors.You have to work inside the loop and outside the loop.What is collaboration? To collaborate means to work towards the same results with several people and, for instance, by creating a document, setting up a project, etc.But the problem lies when emails are heavily used as a collaboration tool.Emails are indeed a very bad place to store permanent information.Understand that collaboration increases the teams flexibility and capacity to adapt.Team members will begin to embrace change rather than fear it and will most likely learn to turn a potentially problematic situation into an opportunity.How do you changeyour ways? How do you get rid of old habits?This is the Current State representingthe supervisor writing down a list of tasks and then distributing them or assigning them to each employee. So it goes from the top to the bottom. That's the way we are actually working today.For instance, sending an email with an attachment to 12 employees in your organization to update a presentation is quite unproductive.Imagine an Excel spreadsheet with 12 people. So here I am updating the spreadsheet. I'm saving it and attaching it to an email, sending it to another colleague. This one is doing the same thing and then proceeding to the next one and the next one. In the end I get that spreadsheet back, but it hass been going back and forth among us.We have been saving it either local in our inbox or on our desktop or some other location. But in the end we have given it so many titles: version 1, version 2, version 3.""Final version"". No, this is the ""one"". Seriously, can you imagine how chaotic this would be? You wouldn't even know what is the most updated version. Here is the delay.Now we want to move,change long-standing practices of collaboration to a new tendency because the tendency is likely for an employee to drop a document in Microsoft Teams and then directly use the co-editing feature or possibly via Office Online or the local application itself.Evolution of the way we work will havea profound impact on the change of corporate culture.Only employees must be driven to this transformation, not only through the use of new digital tools, but especiallythrough a major change of management.From top to bottom doesn't work anymore. We want to make all the employees more autonomous. We want them to think for themselves and to find the solutions themselves in any project assigned.So we're going from microscopic to macroscopic to autonomous. That's what we're really looking for. To change people's way of thinking you must also offer them support in this new approach to work.So what is the purpose of using Teams, in what way and for whom?Discovering and understanding Teams is the first step. First, understand channels and Teams to communicate better.Channels are topics and Teams are basically your tribes of people who come togetherto work towards the same goal.So you have your Teams under your channels, which are your topics.In order to do that, you've got to create your first Team. You also have to know how to access Office 365 online.You need to get your notebook in OneNote or your application SharePoint, Planner, Stream, etc.You must also provide your teams with collaboration, adding tools,by structuring your channels and at the same time demonstrate how to add tabs to integrate third party applications such as Trello, Jira,Adobe and so on.You have to explain the unique access to the tools and files within a single interface, enabling them to understand how Teams can improve their collaborationbeyond conversations and file storage capability.But most of all, using Teams yourself is essential to positively influence others into adopting your project, so you got a short example.First, you put in place base case scenarios.You want to meet the stakeholders within your division or department to define their needs.Then, you want to define use case scenarios, like base business scenarios, and imagine different jobs scenarios.Then you start small by selecting scenarios that correspond to high, low, medium level of difficulties, so that you can implement that impact.The second step would be to conduct pilot tests.Identifying and selecting your professional application scenarios will enable you to set up pilot tests. Conduct a pilot test by including professional users and IT experts.Also get direct users feedback. That's very important regarding their experience with Teams and their ideas for use in further work.After that, share experience feedbacks. That's very important. Ask for instancethe first integrated users to give their opinions, comments and collect any information they may have because overtime sharing examples coming from your own company's or department's user experiencecan be extremely useful to promote and achievesustained change, because sustained change is what we are looking for.Feedback is at the heart of new methods of work from new technologies.Finally,you have to communicate your vision.You have to explain your choices.You have to articulate the benefits expected for the company,the department and employees. Express internal delays,explain the issues.Especially take the time to explain the benefits.How to organize the transformation?You identify first the stakeholders, the key ambassadors and sponsors because those are your friends. Study their profiles as they will be the ones to carry outthe project. Without them, there is no chance of adoption.They are your friends.Study the profiles.Then design, launch and manage your adoption campaign.Deploying the software alone will not bring about change in your organization.You have to create or build a desire for users to use Microsoft Teams.But of course, hide the irritants first, highlight the benefits for the user and the company.Promoting collaboration is more about people and not technology.Too many changes may affect acceptance and productivity. If more than 3 changes are underway, consider facing these out.Then, create an adoption program with the deployment of Teams.The collaborative part above all is a state of mind and values. Educate users to the growing effectiveness and collaboration opportunities that technology offers.Then you want to provide a standard feedback method.Build this method around employees experience.Measure and share the overall success. That is very important. Identify the measures of success in advance by comparing the benefits versus the irritants.Then you adapt your messages and methods based on feedback.The lack of flexibility is a major obstacle to its development.So you have to prepare employees to change the way they work.Resistance to change is the most natural response. You have to reduce the impact.Howto offer teams support.First, they must be at the center of this change. It is essential to offer employees support with training on tools and uses in order to prepare them for cultural change.You have to build their confidence.First, you prepare the cultural change.Users generally do not like change, they especially dislike changes.There are useless and that do not aim to make their life easier.They don't like the fact that they have to relearn everything they know,especially a process they have known for the longest time and that suits them just fine.And why would they want to be out of their comfort zone?No one likes that so the only changes accepted by users are those they perceive as a benefitand added value.So you really have to highlight the benefit.Then you introduce the scope of use.By asking the following questions: When to use this new tool next to my existing technology?Who is allowed to use this tool with me? Is it safe for highly confidential information?Those are the 3 main questions that we run into mostly.You get to the awareness and training portion. You have to provide appropriate training by using case studies or base case scenarios.Offer short training resources with video tutorials, use case scenarios and do not neglect the strengthening of knowledge becauseit allows anchoring of new practices in patterns over the long term and long term is what you're looking for.The proximity relays.Why are those vital?The ambassadors, the coach, the sponsors.Because those people, those friends have tested the tool. They will capitalize and accumulate experience into knowledge.Those same people will influence within the teams through informal conversations, like in cafeteria. They will spread so fastand more effectively anchor the knowledge becauselearning through colleaguesis one of the most effective and the most used methods. Explain the meaning of transformation an reassure those users,share your feedback.and create the emulation, enthusiasm and motivation that promote the adoption of methods of work.You want to have teams apply the new methods of work.Share the feedback with the project team and sponsors themselves.To drive Teams adoption, what are the errors to avoid? Focus on the human being rather than the technical aspects of the project.Focusing on the technical aspect of how Teams is to bring about change is the most common error. The project must be carried by 3 pillars of equal importance:The people, the technology and processes.Excluding VIPs.Involving VIPs in the project could speed up the transmission of information to different teams.Do we want that? In addition to the director of information systems commitment,sponsors do provide visible and active support. You've got to think about a listing.Training and equipping local relays.For a failed adaptation, a centralized online communication will do.The support of a local network of ambassadors would improve efficiency and would cause an overload of activity of the support services.Send only an email as a communication strategy/plan. Avoid sending just a single email.Preparing a communication plan an yet underestimating the importance of communication today is to have the misleading impression of saving time.The reality here is that you are wasting considerable time over the long run with employees that are showing very little motivation and the means are not missing to unite (display, Intranet stand etc.)arounda project and its benefits.Neglecting or skipping training.If the topics are too general and boring,t hose types of training have proven to be counterproductive.However, they are still very useful when they are adapted and contextualized and placed in a particular concept.Imposing the tool or forcing the tool on employees. Don't change anything or rather be brutal, just sort everything out the window.Those 2 reactions are the safest way to failure. It is advised to go for a soft gradual integrationby using baby steps, taking the time to explain things clearly to your employees.This will open the way to abetter adoption and integration.Make Skype and Teams coexist.Forgetting to reinforce change.Users have access to the tools.They have been trained, adaptation is complete. Wrong again: you want to make sure the project is a success.You have to drive adoption to optimize it.Analyze, keep training, keep communicating, offer your employees support at all timesto make that project a succes. Share with them, the overall success.Relying solely on good fortune.Relying on luck and good chance will not lead to a positive outcome. The last common error is to hope that adoption falls in naturally.We must instead anticipate adaptation troubles andat the same timedetect these problems ahead of time, so that we may respond to those issues better and faster.It is as if there was no resistance to change.So.A few good practices.Always run and leave the application open.If you want people to use the application, it should always be open.Teams and Skype coexist very well so start using Teams via instant messaging.Then you want to centralise topics. First, start by centralizing your project information in one place.Avoid the fragmentation of your project simply by using the chat feature instead of email messages when exchanging with the key actors of the project. Work together more closely around common projects.Give visibility into ongoing work. Most of the companies work in ""Project Mode"" with cross-cutting teams and subcontractors which, naturally, induces an explosion in the number of exchanges.Then you want to promote communication.Understand how Teams can improve collaboration beyond the help of conversation and file storage features. The coordination of projects is improving thanks to the almost immediate reactions of colleagues online.Improve readability where you can easily locate information to coordinate teams actions and projects instead of emails.Chat with your team users and communicate with team users from a different organization.Share and co-edit documents. That's the novelty.Answer the questions. Most of the users are scared that another colleague will delete data by mistake.You have to stop sending emails people.121 emails received per day: basically it's an email every 4 minutes.This means that if we prioritize reading emails, we can focus more than 4 minutes at a time on one topic.We always go back to our old habits very fast.So, please try to correct that one immediately. Stop sending emails.In conclusion.Prepare your organization for collaboration in Teams. Encouraging change in your organization is a constant activity, not an event. To successfully drive teams adoption,stay focused on your employees experience.This webinar has finally come to an end.Thank you all for participating to this online session, it's been a pleasure exchanging with you all.Enjoy our platform and get the most out of it.

OneDrive - Discover the online storage tool,"Hello everyone and welcome to this online sessioncalled Discover the Online Storage Tool.My name is Thomas and I will be giving this presentation today.Before I start and in order to ensure that it runs smoothly,it's important that you listen to the following instruction carefully.So the first one is during this presentation,please do not take call waiting or second call.The music on hold will start playingand we'll no longer be able to hear one another.Second one is on your end, please turn the microphone offby switching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know, some of you may be working in open space environment,so those are just cautionary measure to avoidunpredictable or unwanted background noise.The third and last one is to remember to keep your computer screen activeat all times by wiggling the mouse every now and then.It’s very important that you do not let your computer go into sleep mode, as this will cause the interruption of the videoand you will find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience here is that you will have to repeat the log in stepall over again to get back in it.So today, we have 45 minutes to see, well, a few things about OneDrive.First of all, let's just have the little arrows: what is the Cloud?How to load and share documents?How does OneDrive work with Office?A little Q&A in the end,then of course we will see the rest of the study plan.The objectives are to share and collaborate with documents,but also to go to the MOOC platform to further our training.So first of all, let's open a new web page.On this web page, I'm going to look for in the address bar in the top,I'm going to look for portal.office.com.I press Enter and I will be pointed to the Office online portal.So what can we find here?First of all, we are going to find our different applications right here,Outlook, OneDrive, Word, etc.Just by clicking on one of them, well, I will access it directly online.Of course if I want to have them directly into my computer as software,on the top right I can install Office.After it, I will find the different documents.Right here we have the rRecommended documents, but also the Recent ones,the Pinned ones, the ones that are shared with meand the ones that I can discover.Then on the bottom, I will have my recent OneDrive folders,my frequent SharePoint sites and the SharePoint sites that I'm following.On the top left, I will have what we call the online start menu.In the online search menu, I will find back one again my different applications,but if I click on All Apps right here,I will open as you can see a window with all of my applications in it.As you guessed, I have way much more applications right herethan I have on my main page.And of course, on the top right if I want to,I can edit my profile and my account.So let's close that and we will go directly into OneDrive.Before OneDrive opens, let's go back into our PowerPoint presentation.So of course we saw the portal.office.com to access the online start menu,but also what is OneDrive.Well, OneDrive is an online storage space.Your documents will be stored online,which means that you'll be able to access them whenever and wherever you want.Those documents will be saved on this specific unique server,so you won't have to bring your USB keys and your external hard drivewherever you go.No.You just need your login, your password and you'll be ablefrom any Internet-connected device -a smartphone, a tablet, a computer-you'll be able to access OneDriveand you'll be able to find back all of your documents.And I know what you're going to say.""Yeah, but if I update a document on my computer, I don't want every timeto go back on OneDrive to edit it, to have the same document everywhere"".Well, with OneDrive, we can synchronise it with our computer, which means- you are going to see that in a few minutes into the session-with the synchronisation, well,every document online will be synchronised offline,which mean I'll find back all of the different modifications that I've made, but also any modification that I made offline will be online too.So I can edit my documents and if they are synchronised,well, they will be edited online and offline at the same time.And of course we will be able to share our documents.New possibilities: before we had the attached files on our emails;well, no, we'll be able to share our documents.So let's go back on OneDrive right here.Let's talk a bit about the interface.Well, first of all, on the top, we have four possibilities:New to create new documents, Upload to upload documents,Flow to add workflows to OneDrive and Sync to synchronise.We'll go back on it afterwards.On the left, we have the search bar and different tabs.Files, Recent, Shared, Discover and the Recycle bin.Then we have our different SharePoint sites.And of course in the middle, we have all of our different documentsand folders as you can see at the top.So I have right here Confection Sales 2013.Let’s click on it.In here, well, I have different information, but the most important things to rememberis that I can go on it, add information.So I will just add some gibberish and at the top right herewe have ""Confection Sales 2013 - saved"".If I add information, as you will see in a few seconds, ""saving"".So it’s very quick.So we just have to look quick.But ""saving"" because any documents that I have onlineand more specifically on OneDrive, they will automatically save everything that I do,which means that I won't lose anything if there is a power surge,maybe my computer is out of battery, etc., well,it will save everything.Of course we may lose some information, maybe the three or four words last written on it,but well, it's nothing compared to what we are used to.Let's say, we have Excel as a software.We are editing our document, it's been hours.I did not save it because well I would save it at the end.Then power surge, everything is lost.Not with OneDrive, not with the online applications.So also we have, well, the folders.If I click on a folder, I will access whatever is inside it.Nothing new, but it's important to mention it.What about those tabs on the top?New: by clicking on New, I can create a new folder,a new document Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote,but also a Forms document.If I want to, I can also add links.Let's try to add a PowerPoint presentation.Right here, of course, I can do my PowerPoint,add information, add pictures, etc.And right here, we have ""Presentation"".By clicking on it, I can change its name.Let's call it ""Test PowerPoint OneDrive"".It's saved.I can just close it.I can refresh my web page and of course I will find back Test PowerPoint OneDriveright here a few seconds ago as you can see.So I can create any Office documents directly into OneDrive.What's the catch here?Well, our online application are a bit less advancedthan the one installed in our computers.It's not something, well, just crazy.It's not like one of them is in 2019 and the other one is in 2014, no.It's just little possibilities that are not here and there.But once again nothing crazy.We can totally work online without any problem.It’s when we will want to go on more advanced things on our documentsthat it may be difficult because the online version can't manage everything.After it, I have Upload, Files or Folder.Directly from my computer, I can click on Files for example.Here I just have to find a document.I click on Open.It will upload it as you can see in the top right, ""Uploaded 1 item to Files"",and right here we have DD Base PowerBI.Then the workflow of course and we have the synchronisation.We will go back on it at the end of the training session.On the top right, of course, you have uploaded one item to Files,I can show progress if I want to, but well, it’s done so no progress to show.Then I can open the view options menu to see in list,in compact list or in tiles.Also I have the details panel.The text panel, well as you can see, there is just the different information,you edit it, the Base PowerBI, you created, etc.But if I click on a document, let's say, Confection Sales 2013,I check it.Then I click on the top right in the details paneland I will have the activities about this site only.I will have a preview right here, the number of views just under it,who has access to it, it's just me for nowand the different activities right here.Well, I just edited the file, so not really any activity about it.And if I click on More Details, we'll have some more advanced details about it.Let's continue with Confection Sales, we'll either do a right clickor we click on the three little dots on the right.I can open the document, I can open it in Excel Online, but also in Excel installed on my computer.I can preview it, I can share it, we'll go back on it just after,copying a link also, I can download it, delete it,move it to maybe another folder, another SharePoint, I can copy it, same thing, folder or SharePoint, I can rename it, add workflows,a version history and the details.Details, we saw that on the top right with the details panel,that's the version history.As you can see, I have different versions in these documents;one, two, three, four, five and it can go, it’s nearly limitless.So the first version will be the creation of the document.As you can see on the 15th of September 2017 is the creation of the document.And now, seven minutes ago the top, well, it’s the latest edit,the latest modification.If I want to, I can click let's say on the fourth version,can restore it, open it to see what's in it or delete it.If I restore it, I will have as you can see just now a new version,the sixth one.Well, it's the exact same version as the fourth one except now it's in the top.So whenever I open the document, well it will be the sixth versionthat will be opened.Let's talk a bit about the sharing.Right click on the three little dots, Share.Right here, we have a little rectangle on the top.Let's click on it.Who would you like this link to work for?Anyone with the link.Be careful with that.Anyone with the link and of course it's mentioned herethat my organisation is preventing me from taking this option,maybe it will be the case for you.Anyone with the link, it means anyone, anyone in the world.You send this link, I don't know, to somebody you know in Australia,if you work in the US for example, who will be able to open it, no worries.So that's why some companies prevent employees to use this optionbecause well, mistake can occur, we are all humans, and it can happen.People in your tenant name right here with the link.So let's say, you work for a Company 01,it will be people in Company 01 with the link.It is the same as before.You can send the link to anyone who will be able to open it,but only if they have the same tenant as you, so Company 01, for example.People with existing access, you already shared this document before.You don't want to add or remove people in the sharing.You just want to generate a new sharing link.So you just check people with existing access.Then we have specific people.Specific people as the name implies, well, you choose specific peopleby name to share these documents with them.Allow editing; if I want to, I can allow or not the edition of my document.And I can, if I want, block as a download,but as you can see, we have to uncheck Allow editing to block the download.I uncheck it to be able to block it.Yes, we can apply.I need to choose, well, the specific people that I want.I will just add Pierre and Laurent.I can add a message if I want to.""Here is the document I was talking about"".I can send it.If I send it, my co-workers will have access to the documentand they will receive a little notification by mail that just says""Oliver shared a document with you, here is the link"".If I click on Outlook right here, it will open a new mail in Outlookwith the link in it and I will be able to write my own mail with the document.Then lastly, copy a link.I have a little link right here that is now copied.I can paste it on a mail, on instant messaging,on a smartphone message and my colleagues, by clicking on it,will access the document.So it was the sharing and of course right click, copy link,it’s the same as we just saw.We can…Here's our copy link or we can do let's say the long sharingby the Sharing button to be more specific about what type of sharing that we want.Now, on the left.On the left I have the Files tab.So that's what we are talking about since a few minutes.Recent: Recent is the documents that were edited recently.Shared, right here.I will find all of the documents that are shared with me-I am not the creator of it, some people are sharing it with me-but also shared by me, I am the creator of the document,I am sharing it with other people.Discover: it will be documents that maybe I am interested about, maybe not.Just documents I have access to, if I want to I can click on one to see it.And the Recycle bin, well, it will be the documentsbut also the versions that I deleted.I will find them back right here.So the default option for the Recycle bin, the documents stay in here for 30 days,then in the second stage Recycle bin,they will also stay here for 30 days, so you have 60 days in totalto go back and find back your documents, your versions.Let's click back on files right here.We have the search bar on the top left.Right here, you can search for documents.Let's look for ""trends"".And as you can see, I find back two documents that are named ""Trends"".If I click on See More Results, I can filter it.It depends on the date and the type of documents,on the people that created it.I can just edit it right here.Then we have the synchronisation.Synchronisation, if I click on it, well you will have to open Microsoft OneDriveon my computer to synchronise it.I won't do it right here because, well, it may take some few minutes,so I don’t want to make you lose your time.So what is the synchronisation for?We already talked a bit about that in the beginning.If I synchronise a computer, I will have into my File libraryon my computer, I will have a OneDrive folder.In it, I will find the exact same document as I have online.If I edit the documents online, it will be edited on my computer.If I edit it on my computer, it will be edited online.If I delete a document, it will be deleted from the other side as well.And of course, what's the real use of the synchronisation?Well, at any time I'm on my computer, I edit a document,I don't have to load it back on OneDrive.I know that the synchronisation will do it for me.And so, well, just simply, I will have the possibilityto have my document on my computer directly synchronised to OneDrive.I am on the move.I go see my co-workers in another geographical site for my company.Well, I'm going to connect myself to OneDrive,I will find back all of my documents.I don't have once again to bring my USB stick,to bring my external hard drive, etc., no.And they can be stolen as well on the way or on the train, etc.,so no need.We just have to know our log in and password and don't worry,it's very secure because well, there are Microsoft serversand they know that your information, that your data are important,so it's very, very secure.So lastly, we can go on let's say a Word document,so we will open a Word document on the screen from my computer,not from the online version, from my computer.So I'm opening it on the side, it will open on the screen in a few seconds.So we will just open a blank document that doesn't have anything on it.If I go on File on the top left, here I will have Save as to begin withand I can save it on my OneDrive or my SharePoint.But also, I have Share.Directly from my computer, I can share a document with of course OneDrive.And on the top right, I also have Share right here.And so, by clicking on it, I can once again share my documents.It will be the same for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.Let's go back on our PowerPoint presentation.The loading and sharing?Yeah, we saw that on OneDrive, we'll have on the right of the documentif a document is shared or not.And by right clicking on the three little dots, we will have the Share option.For OneDrive and Office, of course, we just saw it.We have in the Files tab, in Files menu, the option to save or to shareour document with OneDrive and SharePoint, to save my documents on OneDrive,to share with my SharePoint site's members on SharePoint.We saw everything that we have to see today on OneDrive.If you have question, don’t hesitate.I'm here to answer them the best that I can.And if you don’t have any question, well, do not forget about our training platform.I know that all of you already know about that.So I won't go back on it.But don't forget about the little calendar to find backall of our training session depending on the date.You don't have to, let's say, you want a training session about SharePoint,you go on the SharePoint's page and you find different dates,but I know the best one for you.Well, even the calendar, you find the date that you want to,let's say, Wednesday, and on Wednesday, you will find backall the training sessions available this day.It may not be SharePoint, but it may be some other training sessionsthat are interesting to you.Then on your dashboard, on the MOOC platform,you have the most consulted, recommended for youand the most recent training sessions.Most consulted and most recent training session,well, it will allow you to stay well on point on what are the most recent ones,the most consulted one, etc.But the recommended for you, the more you follow training sessions,the best will be the algorithm for the training session recommended for you.So well, you will find a training sessionthat you may like that are recommended for you.If everything is good for you today, of course,I thank you for being here today.Put it to good use, put to good use what you learned today about OneDrive.I bid you all a good day.Once again, thank you for comingand I hope to see you all on another training session.",hello everyon welcom onlin sessioncal discov onlin storag toolmi name thoma give present todaybefor start

How to change my status and view my colleagues’ availability,"Hey Coach! I got a question…In Skype, I used to immediately see my availability status as well as my coworkers’. These colored dots made my life easy! Now in Teams, I can locate all my contacts... Yet, how can I be sure that I will not disturb them when I try contacting them?Not a problem.In Teams availability statuses work about the same way.And this is how.In my offline app,I can always see my status thanks to the dot shown next to my profile pic.To change it, I click on my pic and select my new status.When I select a canal, I can see the members pic along with the colored dot indicating their current status next to each comment. And if I wish to find out more, I click on the conversation tab and locate my contact list.I can see everyone’s status and know when they are available to chat with, if needed.So even if the interface looks slightly different, Teams allows me as in Skypeto keep visibility on my status and that of my contacts. All right! It sounds very similar. Thanks Coach!",hey coach got questionin skype use immedi see avail statu well cowork color dot made life easi team locat contact yet sure disturb tri contact themnot problemin team avail status work wayand howin offlin appi alway see statu thank dot shown next profil picto chang click pic select new statuswhen select canal see member pic along color dot indic current statu next comment wish find click convers tab locat contact listi see everyon statu know avail chat neededso even interfac look slightli differ team allow skypeto keep visibl statu contact right sound similar thank coach
How to create contact groups,"Hey Coach! You got to explain something to me.In Skype, I sorted my contacts by groups.In Teams, you got teams… But how do I go about creating contact groups?It is slightly different in Teams. So, this is how you do it. In the desktop application, I click on the conversation tab and then go to my contact list.I then choose to create a new contact group. I give it a name; Once created, this one appears on the left-side navigation. I can then add contacts to this new group,by doing a name search.Subsequently, I can rename this group as needed, or even remove it. Beware, unlike SKYPE, it is not possible in Teams to directly contact all members of a contact group.If I want to contact several of my colleagues,I'll more likely use the team channels.Or on the other hand,through the ""Chat"" mode, I select the first participant then add more as I go along.Even if the procedure is slightly different,just as in Skype, Teams enables me to create and sort contact groups.Great, this makes more sense now.Thanks Coach!",hey coach got explain someth mein skype sort contact groupsin team got team go creat contact groupsit slightli differ team desktop applic click convers tab go contact listi choos creat new contact group give name creat one appear leftsid navig add contact new groupbi name searchsubsequ renam group need even remov bewar unlik skype possibl team directli contact member contact groupif want contact sever colleaguesil like use team channelsor handthrough chat mode select first particip add go alongeven procedur slightli differentjust skype team enabl creat sort contact groupsgreat make sens nowthank coach
How to locate my contacts in Teams,"Hey Coach! One more question…In Teams, how do I go about creating my contacts base again? I mean using the Bluetooth device to do a Skype and Teams synchronization.Not necessary, here! When you switch from Skype to Teams, the synchronization is automated. You will recover your contact list and contact groups without having to do anything extra.This includes your favorite contact list;All your contacts will be sorted the same way.That’s a relief!I thought I had to manually add my contacts one by one,and create contact groups all over again!And what if I had to add contacts and groups?In Skype, I used to locate employees in the company directory by using the search bar… Is it the same in Teams?Exactly, to locate an employee,it is the same as in Skype.First, use the search bar to locate that person; Then exchange and/or add that person to your contact group.Are you telling me that I can add more contact groups? Of course!All you got to do is click on the ""Contacts"" tab,then go to ""Create a new contact group"",then give it a name such as ""Accounting"".To add a contact, just click on ""…"" and then select ""Add a contact to this group"". Can changes be made, anytime?Sure, anytime.Great, this makes more sense now.Thanks Coach!",hey coach one questionin team go creat contact base mean use bluetooth devic skype team synchronizationnot necessari switch skype team synchron autom recov contact list contact group without anyth extrathi includ favorit contact listal contact sort waythat reliefi thought manual add contact one oneand creat contact group againand add contact groupsin skype use locat employe compani directori use search bar teamsexactli locat employeeit skypefirst use search bar locat person exchang andor add person contact groupar tell add contact group courseal got click contact tabthen go creat new contact groupthen give name accountingto add contact click select add contact group chang made anytimesur anytimegreat make sens nowthank coach
Schedule a meeting from Outlook,"Hey Coach! I was wondering... In Skype, I used to schedule an online meeting, directly from Outlook with a simple click of a button. But in Teams, how do I schedule my online meetings?An online meeting from Outlook with a simple click of a button? Guess what…It’s feasible in Teams too!In my Outlook calendar, I have a button that allows me to create a ""New Teams Meeting"".A link to the Teams conference bridge is added directly to my meeting invitation.So, when the time comes,So, when the time comes,the participants will just have to click this link to connect to my meeting.And they will be able to join the meeting,whether internal or external to my company,passing either through their desktop applicationor through their Web browser.Like Skype, Teams is linked to Outlook, so it's always possible to schedule online meetings in a simple fashion!Online meetings with one simple click?Just perfect!

Record a meeting,"Hey Coach! Explain this to me... In Skype I used to record my meetings, and then play back the videos; And then, I would put them online for my colleagues.In Teams, I can find online meetings; All right,but how do I record them?Right, in Teams it’s slightly different.This is how you do it. While I’m in a meeting in a channel, I can start recording it anytime.The recording starts immediately,and Teams shows a notification confirming that I am currently recording the meeting. When it's finished, I stop recording or I just hang up.Shortly after processing time,I can find the link to the recording in the channel where the meeting took place.Indeed, the meeting video is directly recorded and uploaded to Microsoft Stream.I don't even need to share the recorded meeting with my colleaguesas it is automatically available in the channeland accessible any time from Teams or from Stream.The procedure might slightly be different;But Teams enables me to video record my online meetings and save them immediately in Stream!How convenient is that!In a snap, it's recorded!Thank you, Coach!",hey coach explain skype use record meet play back video would put onlin colleaguesin team find onlin meet rightbut record themright team slightli differentthi im meet channel start record anytimeth record start immediatelyand team show notif confirm current record meet finish stop record hang upshortli process timei find link record channel meet took placeinde meet video directli record upload microsoft streami dont even need share record meet colleaguesa automat avail channeland access time team streamth procedur might slightli differentbut team enabl video record onlin meet save immedi streamhow conveni thatin snap recordedthank coach
How to invite external people to a meeting,"Hey Coach! I have a problem! I need to schedule an online meeting with a colleaguewho does not have a Microsoft Office account.In Skype, this colleague had no problems logging in from the Web application;But in Teams, how is that going to be possible?No panic,it is quite possible to make online meetings with external parties in Teams! And that's how you do it.As usual, when I create my meeting, I simply type the email address of my external party in the appropriate field.This party will then receive an email containing a link to the online meeting.By clicking on it, this party accesses the Web version of Teams.This party just needs to fill out the name fieldand join the meeting.This person is then transferred to the meeting waiting room.On my end, when I join the meeting from my Teams application,I get a message telling me that my colleague is in the waiting room.I will give my colleague direct access to the meeting or have him wait a little while longeruntil all external participants are present in the waiting room window.When the attendance is full,I will then start the meeting.I click here to accept my colleague into the meeting.This one then enters the meeting,and I can start this one, as usual!Like Skype, Microsoft Teams allows me to organize online meetings with all my colleagues, even if they do not have a Microsoft Office account email address,and even if they do not have the application installed on their workstation!That's perfect.

How to share your screen during a meeting,"Hey Coach! I need help! I am currently in an online meeting and I would like to show my colleagues some documents.In Skype, it was rather simple.I had the choice between sharing my screen, my window or my PowerPoint...But with Teams, can I do that?Not a problem.Screen Sharing in Teams and Skype are pretty much similar!Let's see how it works.When I'm in a meeting, I click on the share button.Microsoft Teams then opens the sharing tray.I have a choice between sharing my desktop,so that participants can see everything on my screen.I can also share a specific window;For instance: to show only one document.Or, directly share a PowerPoint file.Several files recently opened in Teams are displayed.If none of the files suit me,I can select another one,either directly from Teams,either from my OneDrive,or by uploading it from my computer.Like Skype, Teams offers several sharing options for online meetings.Whether it's my desktop,a window or a PowerPoint presentation…All is feasible!It's perfect, I'll be able to share all my info during this meeting!Thank you, coach!",hey coach need help current onlin meet would like show colleagu documentsin skype rather simplei choic share screen window powerpointbut team thatnot problemscreen share team skype pretti much similarlet see workswhen im meet click share buttonmicrosoft team open share trayi choic share desktopso particip see everyth screeni also share specif windowfor instanc show one documentor directli share powerpoint filesever file recent open team displayedif none file suit mei select anoth oneeith directli teamseith onedriveor upload computerlik skype team offer sever share option onlin meetingswheth desktopa window powerpoint presentational feasibleit perfect ill abl share info meetingthank coach

I then press this buttonand a link to the Teams meeting will be generated.I can then send it to the colleague I wish to invite;And I can do this, via email, for instance.My colleague just needs to click on it to join the meeting.Like Skype, Microsoft Teams offers an easy and quick wayto copy and forward meeting info to other colleagues.And they can join us just as fast!Fantastic!

Create a live event,"Hey Coach! I got a question...In Skype Broadcast, I used to program the live broadcast of an event.And at the end of the broadcast, I could retrieve a video recording;And for instance, I could publish it online.But in Teams, how do I create my live events?No worries!Teams can also program and broadcast live events!That's how it works.To schedule a live broadcast, I go to the ""Meetings"" tab.I choose to create a new live event.I fill in the different information about my event,and I add presenters.Attention: the people I add here are the ones that will help me present that event,not mere spectators!Then I set the permissions and select my event’s production type:either directly in Teams,or through an application or an external device.I also have several options, such as the recording of my event,the creation of a participation reportor the possibility to add a Q&A session via live chat.And just like that, my event is created!I get a participation link which I will share with my colleagues.All right for now; But broadcasting time is due soon…So once live, how does it work exactly?To start my live event, I join the event.I then pick the element I want to start my live session with.I can use my webcam to chat directly with attendees,but I can also share my screenor an open window on my desktop;like a PowerPoint presentation, for instance.I click here to send the item in live broadcast, and I start my presentation.An alert tells me that once I started my live event, I couldn't stop it to restart it.All right, then.It’s better to have all material prepared ahead of timeso to avoid awkward moments of silence during the live broadcast.As this can be... Annoying! Exactly!And during the broadcast, I will be able to share these different contents;Then move from one element to another, as I wish.At the end of the event, I will click on ""End"" to stop live streamingthen leave the session.Phew! Everything went according to plan!But do I still have a record of this event?For instance: A recording for people who could not attend?Yes! Microsoft Teams enables me to keep different resources around my live sessionsbased on what I’ve defined at the creation of the event.If I go back to the details of my event, after a while,I can see that items have been added to the resources.For example: I can find the list of participants and the live chat Q&A report in CSV format.And of course, an audio and video recording of my event,that I can download to my computerand then share it later on my corporate networks.Like Skype, Microsoft Teams has a rich and complete live streaming system,with the ability to keep a record of your live events.And 3, 2, 1, Action!

Instant chat with anyone,"Hey Coach! I was wondering... In Skype, I could initiate an instant chat with anyone,I had the possibility to videoconference, audio call,also screen share.How about Teams, will it let me do all those things?Of course!The interface may be differentbut you get to enjoy the same instant messaging service.So, don’t worry; I’ll show you how it works.In my app, I go to the chat tab,and I select a contact from my list.If the colleague I want does not appear in my contact list,I just type the name in the search field to locate this person.I can then start a conversation by instantly chatting with this colleague.And on the upper-right corner, I can find the videoconferencing,audio calling,and screen sharing options.And just like Skype, Microsoft Teams has the chat featurewhere I can initiate an instant conversation with a colleague at any time.I can also benefit from the audio/video call services…including the screen sharing feature!The full options are there, just perfect!Thanks Coach.",hey coach wonder skype could initi instant chat anyonei possibl videoconfer audio callalso screen sharehow team let thingsof courseth interfac may differentbut get enjoy instant messag serviceso dont worri ill show worksin app go chat taband select contact listif colleagu want appear contact listi type name search field locat personi start convers instantli chat colleagueand upperright corner find videoconferencingaudio callingand screen share optionsand like skype microsoft team chat featurewher initi instant convers colleagu timei also benefit audiovideo call servicesinclud screen share featureth full option perfectthank coach
Instant Group Chat,"Hey Coach! I have a question...In Skype, I could switch from one on one chats to group chat modeby simply adding people to my ongoing conversation with a colleague, let’s say.I know Teams offers an instant messaging service,but now how do I add an additional colleague to an ongoing chat?Oh, yeah! Whatever conversations you may have, it’s always best to obtain a second opinion.And the good news hereis that Teams also gives you the possibility to ask any other colleague a questionin the middle of a discussion, any time!This is how you do it.If I’m already chatting with a colleague and I need to get that second opinion from another colleague(with the know-how on a specific project, for instance)All I got to do, is add that person to that conversation.I run a search with my colleague’s name, then I just press ""Add"".A new group chat tab opens with my two colleagues,and then we can continue to exchange, together!I can give a name to this group conversation to locate it more easily;Especially, if my colleagues and I,are led to Exchange regularly around this same project for example.All right, then…But what if I need to add someone else much later in that conversation…To bring this last person up to speed, will I have to explain everything all over again?Fortunately, you don’t have to!When I add a person to a conversation that already includes 3 attendees,Microsoft Teams offers the conversation history options.Prior to this person’s arrival in the discussion,I will be able to define which part of the conversation history,this one may see.As I want this colleague’s opinion on today’s subject,I will also include today’s conversation historyand then invite this person into the chat group.The discussion goes on without the necessity of a recap.Just like Skype,Microsoft Teams offers the possibility to add a new person to an ongoing conversation.It also lets you rename the group conversation so that it can be traced back easily;And it gives you the option to filter part of the conversation history,in the event you do not want to show some confidential elements from previous history…Not having to repeat everything sounds perfect!It will save me time and headache. This will really come handy.

Changing devices during calls,"Hey Coach! I was wondering... In Skype, I had the possibility to change audio/video devices during a meeting.Is this also feasible with Microsoft Teams?And how do I go about this?Got the feeling that somebody got new headphones!Let’s see how to apply the new settings together.When I'm in a meeting, I just go the star wheeland open the settings pane.I can then select the hardware for all my devices: audio and video.Here, for instance, I will use my headphone’s rather than my webcam’s mic.So, you see, just like Skype, Microsoft Teams lets you change your devices,even during a meeting and with a simple click!I read you loud and clear, Coach!

Delete private conversations,"Hey Coach! I got a question for you.In Skype, I could delete my private and group conversations.But now I can't do it anymore, Coach, is this normal?Yes, it’s quite normal.Simply because Microsoft Teams does not allow the deletion of conversations.Ok… So how do I hide or archive the conversation history?I mean, chats do accumulateand with the volume, I’ll get confused…Don't panic!You may not delete conversations from Teams;However, you do have the possibility to delete some messages within the conversation,thanks to the three tiny dots next to the message.All right, but I need more.I really want some old conversation not to be visible anymore.I really want them gone from the thread of my conversation.Well, in this case, just click on the menu and select ""Hide"".When you reply to a message, the conversation will appear again!So, just remember: It is not possible to delete a conversation from Teamsbut you do have the option to hide a conversationor delete one single element from a conversation!Wonderful!

Use only Microsoft Teams IM service,"Hey Coach! Tell me if I got this right…We agree that Microsoft Teams is more about instant messaging; It is also a complete collaborative space where you can exchange with colleagues, right?So far, yes…So, here is my problem:My company got users who only need instant messaging service and not the full collaborative environment.I see…So how do I get these people to only have access to instant messaging?I mean, is there a ""limited"" or ""light"" version of Teams?Well, to answer your questionwhat you need to know firstis that when you initially launch Teams, you are not automatically added to groups.And this means that you initially only have access to instant messaging: IM.Wow! It is simple as that?Yes, it is.And if one day, you do have the opportunity to integrate this messaging service with a collaborative space, all you got to do then is add the users to these teams.As a result, they all will have access to Cloud applications,document libraries and teams.Who the heck is Cloud?And why, on earth, would they have access to this guy’s teams?Oh no… Cloud is not some guy,it is the name of a document storage and online hosting application!Duh…  The Cloud!My bad.

What are the best practices in Teams ?,"Hello everyone and Welcome to this webinar about ""What are the Best Practices in Teams?"". As you may have noticed your mics are turned off because there are a lot of participants in today's training session, so it would be very noisy if everyone had their mics on. Microphones will be shut off for this training session. Let's begin right now.Some instructions to begin: Turn off call waiting, if you take another phone call during this webinar, the music on hold will be heard by all participants.Microphones are muted, and think of keeping your screen active at all times. If you do not touch your computer for a little while, it will go into sleep mode. If you go to sleep mode, you'll be automatically disconnected from this webinar and there's a time to reconnect to it, so you will lose information.So today, we have 30 minutes to see different things. To begin with, the introduction: What is Teams used for? We're going to talk about Teams. but what is the use of Teams? What are we going to do with it?Then, understanding your collaboration.What can we do in terms of collaboration in Teams? We will understand all of this.The 10 collaboration best practices in Teams. Today is a webinar about the best practice in Teams, so we're going to see them of course.How to spread and share best practices. It's a thing to know about the best practices, but it's another thing to share and spread them in your company. Finally, we'll have the conclusion at the end.The objectives today are to identify the best practices for using Teams and to encourage companies' collaboration in Teams. Also at the end of this training session,if you have other good practices in Teams that we haven't shown today, you can write them in the chat. I'm going to send a message in the chat right now for you to see it.We will be able to send your best practices in it for us to find them back.To begin with, the introduction: What is Teams used for? As you can see on the screen, Microsoft has deployed a graphical representation of how to use their communication applications, because we have Teams, Yammer and Outlook. We have the inner loop, the outer loop and the open loop. The are all important to keep in mind when talking about Teams in comparison to Outlook.To begin with, we have the outer loop on the right with Yammer.The outer loop with Yammer and Outlook. It is called the open loop as well. Outlook is made for your open loop: You can send emails to anyone with an email address. But you should always be careful about what you write in your messagesin fear that someone important could receive it as a transfer. Emails are more formal, more concrete, less arbitrary. Outlook should be used to send official messages to your clients, suppliers, etc.Then we have the internal loop.We have Teams. Teams is really made for your inner loop (the internal loop). Think about the constant conversation that you have with those you work with, including people outside of your company.And the files you review as well.Teams is the right place to work. Conversations are informal, short and direct.You work with very united teams, and that includes external people who are not a part of your network.Teams is destined to become an essential entry point when you start your workday, just like Outlook. Everyday when you go on your computer at work, you open Outlook for your emails. But you should do the same with Teams: All of your inner collaboration conversations will be on Teams.What does Teams allow? Flexible communication in real time, the content and history are available at anytime, including Teams cross-sessions visible to all team members.It's integrated to SharePoint and OneNote. There is a strong integration with the Office suite.And customizable workspace to include content and features that teams use every day.Let's go on. We are going to talk about collaboration.Understanding your collaboration: Nowadays, Outlook is the user's personal EDMS (Electronic Document Management System).It's Well, you're going to find back a lot of documents but it is a bit strange to say that we are going to find all our documents into Outlook because when you send files via emails, the only way to retrieve those files is in the emails. But we're going to talk about this in a bit.In Outlook, the information is stored and contained in the message: Tables, pictures, attachments.The attachments and different or multiple versions of a document are stored in it.But the message storage quota is insufficient. We do not have infinite space in Outlook and we're going to multiply those attachments, pictures, etc. So the storage is insufficient.Meetings and meeting notes are stored. When you organize a meeting in Outlook, you're going to find all the notes about this meeting in here.You spend time looking for information. You have thousands of emails and you have to search, filter to find them back.Of course, managing emails is time-consuming and detrimental to productivitybecause you lose hours because you need to filter, to organize etc. It takes a lot of time.You store the same information as your colleagues in different files and ask them to transmit it when you cannot find it. When someone sends an email to 10 people with attachments in, those same people are going to have the attachment. But you can't find it back because of too much emails, so you are going to ask your coworkers to send it back.You are going to have 2,000 or 3,000 of emails with the same attachments in it, because you cannot find them back in Outlook.That is time-consuming and storage-consuming.Losing messages would be a disaster for the company. Inside emails, you have a lot of important information, attachments, files, documents.The problem here is that we have them in Outlook, so we are not going to download them because we have them in our mailbox.But one day, a problem can occur and your emails will be lost along with important, emails, information and documents.What are we going to do? We cannot do anything, we are going to lose our messages. It's going to be a disaster.When employees leave, their messages may be transferred to another employee so you have. Let's say you have spent 10 year in a company.Today, your coworker who also worked in your company is leaving.So all his emails, 10 years worth of emails are going to be transferred to who? To you.So you have in total 20 years of emails in your Outlook inbox.We can say that is going to be very difficult to store that and to find anything in terms of information or attachments in it.As we know, users are fond of emails. Some even use them too much.In 2016, 250 billion emails have been exchanged every day worldwide.In 2020, forecasts predict 258 billions.Do you imagine every day? 285 billions, it's quite a lot.We are going to see right now the best practices that we can have in Teams.To forget about emails and those time-consuming habits that we have.Our 10 collaboration best practices in Teams.Best practice No.1: I am ready to adopt Teams with my team. What are the best practices to encourage my team to adopt it? The best practice in Teams:You have first of all to specify the guidelines, how teams is used and why.The key is to specify the guidelines that are defined and how it is used and for what purpose. Microsoft Teams is much more intuitive than sending a message to several people with various attachments when brainstorming or collaborating. Be strict about the application of this rule. It may take a few weeks for people to get used to working this way. But once it becomes a habit, is a much more effective way of working.Avoid creating too many teams and channels. Just make sure you don't go crazy with the creation of tons of channels.If it's time-consuming to find information in our list of emails, it will be time-consuming as well to find information in a list of 100 channels.Set up a naming convention and classifications. Keep in mind that Microsoft Teams is intended for consistent collaboration: Chat, document, task within a collective group of people whether it's a department or project team.Naming convention and classifications to avoid language slippage, generic channel naming to avoid multiplicity.It will ease access to these documents, conversations and various information to new employees in the team.Then, second best practice:Dozens of messages are about the same topic.What's the best practice in Teams?To begin with, we have to centralize topics.Enable the real time collaboration.We have to create one channel for each project, we remove the unnecessary tabs.And manage the display of your favorite teams.Add important teams to favorites to find them back at the top of the teams.Hidden channels and teams: We have a project that is over but for some reason we have to go back on these teams to find information. Let's hide them.If we hide teams and channels, they are still here. They are not deleted, they are still in Teams but they will be hiddenat the bottom of our teams list. We can find them back, but at least it's way more organized.We can also archive teams with completed projects.When we are over with a team, everything is done, we do not need it anymore, we can archive it.This team will be in the archives. We not need to go back on it, but we archived it.Let's continue with the best practice No. 3:I often exchange messages with the same group of people.The best practice in Teams:Use team conversations, so you don't lose history.If you send emails or use Skype to send information, at a moment or another you are going to lose track of everything.In Skype and Outlook if you need to search for minutes and minutes to find information, it is not worth it.In Teams, you have a conversation feed, you just have to scroll up and scroll down to find information.You can also create new topics so other people can respond to them.You will save time to find the answer.You can create different topics and in the comments of these topics you will find the information. You can answer the existing topics by enriching them with GIF, emojis or stickers.It will enable quick exchange, showing notes or calendars and documents. With GIF, emojis and stickers, you can have more casual conversations, it will be more interesting to have some icons, etc.Convert a text exchange into a face-to-face video meeting.You have a lot of information to transmit to your coworker.If you start to write the equivalent of a book in Teams, it will be difficult to find information or even to read all of it.You can create a face-to-face video meeting.You exchange information with your coworker, your partner and he is not on the side of this meeting so you can write important information and the less important one will only be in your mind.Let's continue with the best practice No. 4:I need to distinguish when I am copied in or when I am the main recipient of an action.The best practice in Teams: We are going to use mentions. In Teams, you can mention people by usign the @. They will receive notifications and the names will be in purple.This way people will know when they are the main recipient of an action.If there are only copied in, they can read it if they want to.To stay informed about new publications you can follow channels. It's possible in Teams to follow channels and to received notifications when there is a new publication.You will always be ready to received this new information.Mask those which do not concern you.In Teams you can mask channels. You will not hide them for everyone, only for you.In your current project in Teams there are tabs about the marketing but you don't work in marketing, it's not important for you. You can hide it and you will only find back the different channels that are interesting for you.Stay informed with the activity alerts.In the activity tabs in Teams, we will find all the alerts and notifications about things that concern you. When you follow a channel, when someone mentions you.You just have to go in the alerts and you will find the different notifications.Let's continue with the best practice No. 5:I regularly forward messages to inform people. The best practice in Teams: Use the wiki tab as a team logbook.If you have a lot of information or messages to forward to everyone every time, those people are on your Teams. Go on the Wiki tab.In it, you can put important formation.Instead of forwarding messages to the 10 same people everyday, go into Wiki.Put the important message here and those 10 people will be able to read it with one click: Less emails and quicker way to find information.You can also add a netbook to collect notes and knowledge. Create a team notebook and, like in Office 365 NoteBook or OneNote, you can add notes, knowledge, images, etc.You can put a link in a conversation to highlight a document.You have a document in your Teams library and you can take the link, put it in a conversation and everyone will access the document just by clicking on it.It is a quicker way to exchange and collaborate on a document.You can use tabs to access other services.In Teams you can add services in the tabs. There are a lot of different possible applications and you can also use social networks such as LinkedIn, Trello, Jira, etc.You can also put different documents in the tabs. You can ask contacts to send an email directly to the channel because it's possible in Teams to send an email to a specific email address and this email address is the Teams.In the channel, the email will appear as a normal message, a normal conversation.Let's continue with the best practice No. 6: I often send and receive emails to update documents and my storage quota is insufficient.You have your document, your coworkers update it, they send a new one. Then you update it, you send it back, etc. Then you have 10 attachments which are the same emails but updated each time.The best practice in Teams: Facilitate collaboration on documents. Document shared by Teams are stored in the document library of the associated SharePoint site. A SharePoint site is made to store documents, not like Outlook. A folder is created in the library for each channel. So in SharePoint you have a folder and this folder will be different for each channel.Folder for channel 1, channel 2, etc.Share files as links. You can use links to share documents.You share documents in one place, SharePoint for example,  and copy the sharing link to send it to someone.This person will not have to store it anywhere, it is just a link.You can work with several people on a document. You can co-edit documents open in Teams online or via the heavy client (the software on your computer). The version control is enabled by default for shared document. You can control different versions: In case there is any problem in a version, you can go back to the latest one.You can discuss while modifying. You can discuss with meetings directly in Teams or via a chat conversation open when you are editing a document and so you can discuss with your coworkers.Then, the best practice No. 7:I often send the same attachments.The best practice in teams: Customize your tabs to make it easier to access recurring files. You create a tab which is about a document and by clicking on it you will access it.Copy the link to a document to put it in a conversation. You copy the link, you go in the conversation, to the comment and you put the link here. Everybody will be able to access it.Add documents to the conversation instead of the Files tab if you want them to be seen. The Files tab is to store documents, but in the conversation, you send the document and everybody will see it directly.There is no need to go in the files library, it will be in the conversation.The best practice No. 8: I often look for information.In Teams, you can save important messages. By saving them, you can find them back easily.You can pin your conversations. You pin them and you will be able to find them back quicker.Use filters in activity flows. By using filters, you can find specific information quicker.Use the search engine and filters. If we know what we are looking for, by using the search engine and the filters we will take way less time than we do on Outlook for example.Best practice No. 9: I often waste time in meetings, I would like to be more efficient.The best practice in Teams: With Meet Now, you can easily and quickly switch from a conversation to an impromptu meeting.You can promote audio and video conferencing and you can record meetings to make them available to other team members who are absent.All of your meetings will be stored and you can send them to people who are not here.Best practice No. 10: During meetings, I share information with other people.Best practice in Teams: Share your screen, it's way easier to share information if people can see it.Set up a share notepad to co-publish the note-taking during meetings. If we have 10 people in the meeting, then 10 notepads and 10 notes to put in the same notepad would be too long. If we have only one notepad for 10 people and everybody can co-publish it, it will be easier and quicker and you can exchange information via conversation during the meeting.Then we have a bonus best practice: I often send attachment to people on the move.Best practice: Install the mobile application. Teams in on smartphone so you can take your Teams with you. With the mobile app you can find teams, channels, documents, conversation, and tabs directly on your smartphone. It's perfect when you are on the move.How to spread and share best practices?You have to rely on a network of ambassadors. Explain the meaning of the transformation.They will influence within teams, through informal conversation that will help knowledge to be disseminated and anchored more effectively. Learning through colleagues is one of the most effective and widely used methods.Reassure them: They will be scared because it's new, you have to reassure them. Since they have tested the tools, they will capitalize and accumulate experience to transform it into knowledge. Share their feedback on it.Then we have to raise awareness and train employees.Use the collaborative digital platform, it will offer an adapted training using concrete cases. Propose short training resources: Tutorial videos,use case scenarios, etc.Set up dedicated physical meetings. The purpose will be to enable continuous improvement in each entity to address cross-cutting issues such as local initiatives.Do not neglect knowledge building as it enables new practices to be anchored in habits over the long term.Coming soon: Courses about the best practices.In conclusion, Microsoft Teams is ideal for daily communication and collaboration within a department, project team or group of people working closely together with a common goal or deliverable. Outlook is for formal things. Use Teams for daily tasks.If you have any questions, you can ask them directly in the chat.For those who do not have questions, I thank you for being here today. Make good use of what you learned and I wish you to have a nice day.",hello everyon welcom webinar best practic team may notic mic turn lot particip today train session would noisi everyon mic

Discovering Outlook Online,"Hello everyone and welcome to this training session about Outlook Online2and more specifically ""Discovering Outlook Online"". What can we do with it?3Beforehand we have some instructions4turn off call waiting,5think about muting your mics or else6everybody will be able to hear the noise behind you7and keep your screen active at all times.8If you let your computer go into sleep mode,9you'll be automatically disconnected from this training session.10So think of moving the mouse from time to time to remind the computer that you're still here.11If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask them.12Just call me by my name.13By the way, my name is Thomas14Just ask your question, it will be better if we have a real interaction during this training session.15Today we have 45 minutes to see how to login to the portal.16On the portal, how can we access Outlook Online?17We're going to see Outlook Web App,18Outlook Online, and what we can do on it.19Finally, we are going to see some little tips on Outlook to begin on it more easily.20The objective today is to discover the Outlook Web App interface.21I'm going to put it on the screen right now.22As you can see, I'm on on my online Office portal.23I can find all of my different applications and on the top left we have Outlook.24But also in case Outlook's not here,25you can click on the little online start menu, on the top left, the app launcher26and here is Outlook.27and if I click on ""All apps"" in the middle,28I will find all of the applications I have access to with my user profile.29And, on it, I easily find Outlook.30I clicked on it, and now Outlook is open on my screen.31Let's begin with the interface.32What is on Outlook and what can I use?33To begin with, on the top we have the ribbon.34On the ribbon, we can create a new email, calendar, event or group35and I can also mark all as read.36On the right, I have the ""Undo"" button37in case I've made a mistake for example, I marked as read.38I'll be able to undo it, for example I delete it, undo and it will be right back.39On the top right, we have ""The new Outlook"" functionality.40If I click on it, my interface will change a little.41As you can see, I have ""Empty folder"", ""Mark all as read"", ""Undo"", etc. on the top left.42And ""New message"" on the far left.43It's a different interface but we are not going to work on it today.44We're going to use the old Outlook.45Also on the left, I have the search menu.46I have my folders47and by clicking on something for example, ""Deleted Items"",48I can find all the emails I have deleted on my Outlook Online.49 Let's go back to the inbox.50I also have the search bar.51If I click on it,52I can search for an email from Amaury.53I found Amaury and by clicking on it54I will find all of the emails from him.55I can search in all folders,56in the inbox,57in the conversations, deleted items on in the groups.58From Amaury, Pierre, etc.59I also have different options.60Do I want to my email with attachment or not.61If I select it,62I only have one email from Amaury with an attachment.63I can also change the date.64Forever, this week, last week, etc.65I can also select a range.66If I click on other inbox, etc.67I will be on the other folders.68I can also search by subject69for example, the subject is Teams.70As you can see right here,71I have all of my emails that contain ""Teams"" in the subject.72But as you can see73in ""Alpha Project"", we do not have Teams in the subject.74If I click on it, Teams is directly in the email.75because Outlook is capable of looking for the title,76but it can also look for the subject (Teams)77directly in the body of the email.78Let's exit the search.79I also have the possibility to click on Oliver Lodge80and Groups81and I have all of my different folders and groups.82Because the Outlook groups are linked to Outlook83and I can find them here directly.84Now we are going to use a different things.85On the top, we have the Filter.86By clicking on Filter87I can filter by all of my emails,88the unread ones, etc.89Let's try the unread one.90Here, I can find all of my unread emails.91I can also close it92and filter once again93only the emails that are flagged.94I only have two of them, etc.95So it is just a quick filter.96I can also sort by date, from, to, subject, etc.97Let's sort by ""from"".98In here, I have ""Alpha Project""99then Amaury, etc.100By going at the bottom, I will have different people.101Let's wait a bit for it to load.102Here I have construction site, Dina, FindTime, etc.103So it will be in alphabetical order.104I can show as messages or conversations.105What's the difference?106Messages are simple emails.107Let's say you send an email: it will be in your sent box.108The the person answers: you will receive the answer and that's all.109But if you put in conversation mode,110every time someone answers an email,111by clicking on it, you will be able to see all of the conversation history112during the email exchange.113So instead of having different messages114you will only have one with all the different messages directly in it.115Then, let me show you the focused inbox.116I click on it and I have Focused and Other.117It's basically a filter directly in Outlook.118What is the difference between Focused and Other?119In Focused, you will find the important emails120from coworkers, recognized companies, etc.121In Other, you will emails that are not so important but aren't spams neither.122In Other I can find Amaury Sylvestre in Teams123because Amaury shared a document in Teams.124It's not a spam because it's interesting125but it's not a priority message.126So it will be in Other.127Outlook will learn what you do.128Let's say in Other, every time you read emails ""X in Teams""129and then you put it in Focused130and do that every time for a little while,131Outlook will understand that you want the emails from Teams in the Focused inbox.132Another example:133Alpha Project, every time you do not read them and just delete them,134after a while, it will directly go in Other135and in Other, if you delete all emails without reading them136they will go, after a while, in the spam inbox.137So Outlook will learn with what you do in your inbox.138Then we can right-click on an email and there are many possibilities.139I can reply to this email, reply to all the people in the email, and forward it to someone.140I can delete my email or archive it.141I can mark it as unread or flag it.142Mark as junk or ignore it.143Move to Other inbox,144always move to Other inbox.145So if you do not want to wait for Outlook to understand what you want to do146you can always move to Other inbox.147I can move to Other inbox148Steven, inbox, training, conversation, clutter, etc.149I can categorize. What is a category?150With the Categorize option151I have the possibility to put a little code on my email.152For example, let's go on it and click on ""Manage categories"" at the bottom.153Here, I can add a new category.154Let's call it ""Omega Project"".155By clicking on left on the little white square, I can select a color.156I will select the pink one.157Then I click on OK.158OK again.159Now, right-click on an email. Let's look for real email160Not an invitation.161Let's take this one.162Right-click, then categorize163and let's select Omega Project.164Now I have on the right, on my reading screen,165Omega Project with a pink rectangle.166I also have it in the inbox.167So by using this, you can quickly find your emails.168And if you right-click, categorize, you can put multiple categories.169Categorize, yellow. I have 3 categories right here and 3 categories on the left as well.170In the filter, I can sort by... We do not have categories here171but if we want to we will be able to find them rather quickly172because of the different color code.173I can find my emails:174I know that pink is for Omega Project and without looking at it, I know it's Omega Project.175Let's continue with the right-click.176Here, I have ""Create rule"".177By clicking on it,178I will be able to create a new inbox rule.179Let's give it a name. Let's call it ""Quick move"".180Then I ask to look for specific conditions.181If I click on the first condition182I ask multiple things: it was sent or received,183includes these words, my name is, it's marked with,184Its size is within a specified range, it's received within a specified date span or apply to all messages.185Let's select ""It was sent or received"",186received from Amaury Sylvestre.187We already checked that.188""Do all of the following"".189I want to move it or I can pin it, mark it, forward it.190So I want to move it to the drafts.191""Add action"".192I want to mark the message with a category.193And I want the Blue category.194Then, ""Except if it matches any of these condition"": I can add exceptions.195For example, if it's marked with importance, let's say ""High"".196After this, either I stop processing more rules197or I can continue to process rules even if the emails have already been moved.198I click on OK.199From now on, every new email that I receive that matches those conditions200will automatically be sent to the Drafts folder on the left.201Right-click,202I can show in immersive reader.203If I click on it, my email is now in a specific reader.204Once again, right-click205""View message details"" or ""Assign policy"".206I can delete it after a specific time207for example, every year every email will be deleted as specified in the ""1 Year Delete"".208If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them.209Now, we're going to see how to create a new message.210If I want to create a new message211I go at the top in the ribbon, but because I selected a message212my ribbon has new features.213I can delete it, archive it, put it in the junk,214sweep it, I can move it to Other inbox,215categorize it, and with the ellipsis, I find the different possibilities that I had before.216Now, let's click on New to create a new email.217On the right, I have the place where I write the email,218I will send it to Amaury.219I can add a carbon copy220but also, on the top right I have ""Bcc""221and I can add the blank carbon copy,222which means that I will be able to send an email to someone as a copy223but the original recipient won't be able to see that I have added people in carbon copy.224I can add a subject, I will put ""Hello All!"".225and ""Please find..."".226In my email, at the bottom, I can change the format and the font.227For example, let's select that.228It will take a few seconds to load, let' select Century Gothic and it will change.229Put it in bold, italics, underline, highlight...230But also change the color of the font,231I can add bullets, numbering, etc. I have a lot of possibilities.232At the bottom I can send my email, discard it,233I can attach files from my computer or from a cloud location.234What is a cloud location?235If I want to, I can select a file from my SharePoint or OneDrive236and I will be able to send it directly here with a sharing link.237If I click on it238I have my files, I select ""Book 1"".239""Next"". It will ask me if I want to share it as a OneDrive link or attach as a copy.240If I attach it as a copy, it will be a copy241that I send to Amaury.242If he edits the document, it won't be edited for me243because it's only a copy.244But if I share it as a OneDrive link, Amaury will be able to edit the document245and this document will be edited for me as well because it's a shared document.246I can add pictures,247little emojis,248and share my availability.249If I click on it, I can select availability,250click on insert and say that I'm available today from 9 AM to nearly 12 PM.251Then I can choose to have the formatting options or not.252And with the little arrow, I can save as a draft, insert my signature,253show from, check names, set importance, switch to plain text,254shows message options and check for accessibility issues.255If I click on ""Show message options""256I can request a delivery receipt,257I can request a read receipt,258encrypt this message, digitally sign this message or add sensitivity.259I cancel it but if I want to I can send it260which I won't do here because it's only a demonstration.261Now we're going to use some of the options in the parameters of Outlook.262On the top right, there is a little cog.263If I click on it, different parameters and options appear.264To begin with, on the top, I have ""Automatic replies"".265By clicking on it, I can create an automatic reply for when I'm out of the office.266I click on ""Send automatic replies"".267I can either send them whenever, beginning right now268or I can send replies only during this time period.269Let's check that.270Start date: today at 6 PM271to the 15th at 9 AM.272I can block my calendar for this period, let's do that,273and the title will be ""On vacation"".274I can automatically decline new invitations occurring during this period275and decline and cancel my meetings during this period, let's do that as well.276Select which message to use when declining or canceling events during the period.277So I can create a message if I want to.278I can use a reply for people inside or outside my organization or create a message to include the reply.279At the bottom I can add the message that will be automatically sent to people who send me emails.280""Hii, I'm away for a few days. Please leave or contact Pierre Skolil for any request. Thanks""281I can also send automatic reply messages to senders outside my organization.282If I check I will have to create a new message.283I click on OK at the top left. From this evening at 6 PM until the 15th at 9 AM284I won't be available and my meetings will be canceled, etc.285Let's close this.286There are other options, but the one I want is not here.287In ""Search all settings"", I can put for example, ""signature"".288As you can see, ""Email signature"" is right here.289Here. I can choose to write my signature.290By default it's ""Best regards, Oliver"".291I can automatically include my signature on new messages I compose292or automatically include my signature on messages I forward or reply to.293I create my signature and click on OK.294Now if I create a new email I see ""Best regards, Oliver"" with the signature.295Let's continue.296Now we have the display settings.297It is what I want my interface to look like.298For the Reading pane: on the right, at the bottom or hide it.299But also for the message list:300choose how to display your messages, sender name or subject first301show preview text or hide it.302I have different display settings. I won't go through all of them303because it is how you want them to be so it's not specific parameters,304it is only what you want to do, and what you want to add directly in Outlook.305I will let you check on that yourself.306At the bottom, I can change my theme.307You have the little construction bricks and if I click on that308at the top I have construction bricks, etc.309I click on some of them and it will automatically change.310Let's change to the one I had before,311Let's say a light blue, it's good.312I choose it, I save.313And now everything changes to light blue:314on top of the ribbon, the little marker in the inbox or even my emails315an even my text on the right.316Everything changed from dark blue to light blue. If I select dark orange,317everything is dark orange now.318So it's a quick way to change my display.319Let's go back to our PowerPoint.320Today we saw the portal, portal.office.com,321and the online Start menu with all my apps here.322In Outlook we looked at the file explorer323and with the right-click I can enable all of the possible actions.324The cog icon is for the settings.325If you have any questions right now, do not hesitate to ask them.326If you don't have questions, I thank you for being here today with me.327Make good use of it.",hello everyon welcom train session outlook online2and

Getting familiar with Office Online,"Hello everyone and welcome to this training session on how to get familiar with Office Online.2My name is Thomas and I will be your trainer today.3Before we begin, we have some instructions to ensure the good quality of the session.4First of all, turn off call waiting.5If you take another phone call during this training session6we will all hear the hold music7so turn off call waiting and do not take another phone call.8In case there is noise around you,9colleagues working, people talking etc.,10please mute your microphone11so the audio quality will be the best possible.12And also keep your screen active at all times.13If you like your computer go into sleep mode14you'll be automatically disconnected from the training session15so it will take some time to reconnect and you will lose information.16Lastly, if you have any questions during this training session17do not hesitate to ask them.18as I said before, my name's Thomas so call me by my name, ask the question and I will answer it.19It will be better if you do it like that because the training session will be interactive20and it won't just be me talking for 45 minutes.21So today, we have 45 minutes to see different things.22First of all, we'll see the Cloud computing basics:23How does the cloud work? What does it do?24Then we will see what happens when we are logged into the Office 365 portal.25Then, we will see the difference between OneDrive and SharePoint.26Finally, the Office Online package: Excel, PowerPoint, Word and OneNote.27The objective today is to discover the Office Online interface.28Let's begin with the Cloud computing basics.29We can have a computer, a laptop, a tablet and a smartphone.30On all of those different devices, we will have access to Office.31On a laptop and computer, we will have the online Office package.32On a tablet, we will have the Office web apps.33And on a smartphone, we will have the Office mobile applications.34Office 365 will group: Exchange, for professional mailbox,35SharePoint, for document sharing,36and the Lync system (Skype and Teams), for HD video and web conferencing.37What's the use of Cloud computing basics?38Its Accessibility.39Wherever I am and whenever I want, I will have access to Office and the applications.40The compatibility.41With Office 365, you can open documents that are older than the current version.42If you have the 2019 version, you can open a 2007 version document.43Security.44It's hosted on Microsoft servers and they are very secure.45The serenity.46You won't have to stress out for your information or documents because it will be very easy to find them.47Now that we have seen how Cloud computing basics work,48let's talk about the portal49portal.office.com50that we will access in a few minutes.51So on, we will find our different applications52and the online start menu.53And on it we will find all out apps.54I will open the online portal on the screen.55On it, we will have our different applications.56Outlook, OneDrive, Word, etc.57All of our apps.58On the top right, you have ""Install Office"".59If you want, you can install the software directly on your computer.60If you don't want to go on the online version, you can have the desktop version.61We have the documents.62Here we have the recommended documents.63What does it mean? It is the document I have access to64but they may have been shared with other people or with me65and they've been edited recently66so I can open them and see the modifications.67Then we also have the documents, the shared documents,68the recently shared documents,69the pinned documents,70the documents that are shared with me71and the documents that I've never seen at that I can discover.72To pin a document, it is very simple.73We have ""Demo 2019"" here,74I click on the little pin75and if I go in Pinned, we have ""Demo 2019"" here.76At the bottom, we have a OneDrive and a SharePoint folder.77In OneDrive, we will find the recent folders created or edited.78In SharePoint, I will find the frequent sites that I've consulted and the sites that I'm following.79For both of them I can go directly to the app: ""Go to OneDrive"", ""Go to SharePoint"".80On the top left, we have the online start menu.81In it, I will find some applications.82If I click on ""All apps"" in the middle, I will find all of the applications that I have access to with my user profile.83I have a search bar.84I'm looking for Sway: ""swa"" and under it, I have Sway.85Let's close that.86On the right, we have ""Upload and open"" and ""New"".87From the Office 365 front page, I can directly create or upload documents:88Word document, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Forms and Sway.89With a single click, I can create a new document.90Now let's click on the little cog on the top right: ""Settings"".91In the settings, I will be able to edit themes.92I have the light blue, but I can use the Office themes, dark blue, rainbow, etc.93I have a lot of them to edit my front page with the one I like.94I clicked on ""View all"" and I have a lot of them.95Let's keep the default one.96After it we have ""Language and time zone"".97If you're fluent in another language or maybe your Office portal is in the language of your company or you speak another language fluently,98you can choose another language and time zone here.99You can customize the settings for your notifications, change your password and update your contact preferences.100The little bell represents the notifications.101There is nothing now, but it can be Outlook, OneDrive notifications, etc.102The question mark is for help.103I need help and I will try with Sway.104""Sign in to Sway"", ""Getting Started with Sway"", etc.105This is the Help menu.106If I click on my own picture107I can access my profile and my account.108In my profile, let's wait for it to load...109I will be directly on an application called Delve.110We won't talk much about Delve because it's not the topic of the session111but you will find are all the information about you and your coworkers112and you will be able to update your profile.113You can see ""Contact information"",114""About me"", ""me in a few words"", different projects, ""Skills and expertise"",115projects I'm working on, ""School and education"", ""Interests and hobbies"".116Let's continue with My account.117In my account, I will have a lot of different tabs.118My account, Personal info, Subscriptions, Security & privacy, etc.119We won't go into all of them, but in the account I have a lot of information, a lot of things that I can change and edit.120Let's go back to our portal.121I will click on the online start menu122and we'll talk about OneDrive and SharePoint.123Let's go back on it.124What's the difference between OneDrive and SharePoint?125First of all, let's look at OneDrive.126OneDrive is a personal online storage space.127This means that you can put all of your documents, or the one you want, in OneDrive.128By doing it, you will be able to find them whenever you want.129For example, you are at work on your computer130and you put your important documents on OneDrive.131You come back on the following morning132and surprise, your computer had a problem during the night, it's not working anymore, the hard drive is broken.133So it's not usable, you lost all of your information and documents.134If you go on OneDrive with other computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.135you will find all of the documents you put here136because it's online, it's secure, and so you won't lose your document whatever happens to your devices.137It's not linked directly to your devices: if it's broken, OneDrive is OK.138So OneDrive is more personal.139You put your document in it: it is for you and only you, with some possibilities to share it with coworkers,140but with very small teams.141You can, but it's not a good idea, share your documents on OneDrive with hundreds of persons.142It's better to share it with a few people.143We also have SharePoint.144SharePoint is the opposite of OneDrive145OneDrive: small teams, a bit of sharing, but it's mostly for me.146SharePoint is to work as a team.147You will have a SharePoint site148And in the SharePoint site, you will have documents.149Those documents will be available for all members of this site.150It can be 3 persons or several hundreds.151So OneDrive is more personal and SharePoint is to share with a lot of people.152OneDrive is only for storage and sharing153and SharePoint is like a website for your team.154We will see that in a few seconds.155Let's click on OneDrive to begin with.156On OneDrive I have different folders and files.157Quite simply, I can click on ""New"", on the top, to add a folder or document.158I can click on ""Upload"" to upload files and folders.159And we have ""Sync"".160""Sync"" is also called synchronization.161Synchronization is to link your online OneDrive with your computer162but don't worry, even if your computer has a problem, your OneDrive won't have a problem even if you are linked/synchronized.163It means that you can have a folder on your computer which is directly synchronized with OneDrive online.164You put a document in it, it will appear on OneDrive online.165You put a document in OneDrive online, it will appear in your folder on your desktop.166It is the same if you delete or edit documents.167It will be a link between the online and the desktop.168Everything you do on one side will affect the other side.169Quickly, let's click on ""New"" to create a new folder for example.170Let's call it ""Omega Project"".171We have the Omega project right here.172I click on it to open it.173""Files"", ""New"", let's create a simple Word document.174A new tab is opening.175In here, I have Word online.176I can write whatever I want,177I close it,178and here I have Document.docx.179Right-click, ""Rename""180and let's call it ""Important info"".181Let's save it.182I have my document right here.183It's quick, it's simple and it's quite easy.184This is OneDrive.185This is a training session that will only deal with OneDrive and SharePoint.186Let's close OneDrive and go to SharePoint.187SharePoint is quite different from OneDrive.188First of all we have different sites, news from sites, frequent sites and suggested sites.189As I said before, on SharePoint we will have little websites.190On those sites, we will be able to do whatever we want.191hide information, get information, add documents, etc.192On the top left, I click on ""Create site"" to create a new site.193But for now, let's go in Project Alpha in Frequent sites.194Once again, it's quite different from OneDrive.195It's not a file library, we have one on the right,196but it's like a web page.197I won't go in further details198but by clicking on ""Edit"", we are able to edit the page, to add information and documents.199We can add web parts and I have a lot of them.200So we can edit our SharePoint site to look like whatever we want.201So we can create our own little website directly in SharePoint.202On the left, one of the tabs is named ""Documents"".203I click on it.204Here I will find all my documents. I only have one folder.205All the documents I have here, it's the same: Word, Excel, etc.206All the documents I have here will be shared automatically,207it is very important,208with all members of this SharePoint site.209If I look on the top right, I have 2 members:210Oliver and Stephen.211By default, whenever I add a document here, because I am using the Oliver Lodge training profile,212all documents will be available for Steven by default.213I can check on other sites as well.214If I go on ""Test Team 101"",215let's wait a few seconds for it to load,216I have 5 members: Maxime, Pierre, Amaury, Oliver and Lisa.217By default, if any document in here, they will have access to all of them.218Like this, I can share documents with a large number of people219inside or outside my company.220On SharePoint and OneDrive, you can share document with people outside your company.221On SharePoint, you can add members that are colleagues from another company,222people are working closely with us.223We can add them in SharePoint, even customers if we want to.224With OneDrive and SharePoint, we have the ability to share documents without problems.225Let's close OneDrive and SharePoint.226We have one last thing to see.227It is Office online package: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.228As I said before, you don't need to have them installed on your computer to use them.229Directly from the online version, from the online portal230you can use them.231Let's begin with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.232We will see what they use.233First of all, we have Microsoft Word online.234Microsoft Word Online is to write documents.235I can choose a template for my document: Open house flyer, 5-day trip planner, etc.236I will be able to find all my recent Word documents,237my pinned documents, Word documents that are shared with me238and the documents that I have to discover.239Let's click on ""New blank document"".240Here, I will be able to write whatever I want because it's Word.241The important thing to know is that the online version of Word has less features than the desktop version.242because online it is not possible to have exactly the same features.243It's the case for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.244I will only have some features but they are the most important ones.245On the top we have a lot of tabs with a lot of possibilities anyway.246An important thing is that if I write anything, on the top you see ""Document 2 - Saving"".247If I stop writing for a few seconds, it's finally saved as you can see248It means that I don't have to save my documents manually.249If I want, I can write whatever I want,250I close the document251and in a matter of seconds I will retrieve my information.252Why is it so good?253Let's say you are working on a document on Office Online254and without a warning the electricity shuts off.255We don't have anymore electricity in the company and I was working on a computer,256not a laptop, and it was only working because it was plugged.257So my computer doesn't work anymore.258But my document is still OK259because it was saved automatically.260I don't have to stress out because I've been working on it for 3 hours and I did not save: it's OK.261You've lost the 3 or 4 last words but it's not the worst case possible.262Then we have Excel.263Excel works like Word.264I can use a template and Recent, Pinned, Shared with me and Discover (still on Word).265Template, Recommended, Recent, Pinned, etc.266I create a new workbook.267I think you already know Excel.268I have a soft online application269to use as a table.270As before, I can write whatever I want271and I will have all the features I need.272Once again, I have less features than on the desktop version.273But I still have the insert function button.274So it is quite easy to find what I want.275On PowerPoint online.276We have the same things as before.277What's the use of PowerPoint? It's to create presentations.278I have to present something to my co-workers, my customers, etc.279I can use PowerPoint.280I can add pictures, text, sound, videos, music, etc.281I will have many possibilities in PowerPoint to make it an interactive and interesting presentation.282Then we have OneNote online.283Maybe you don't know about it.284What's the use of OneNote?285Let's click on an existing notebook: ""OneNote 101"".286On OneNote we have a notebook287and then I will have different sections288and in those sections I will have pages.289I can give a name to these pages, let's call it ""test"".290And I can write whatever I want on it.291It's like a real notebook but online.292So I can write wherever I want, I can scribble on it.293If we go in ""Draw"",294I can scribble.295and I can also insert documents, pictures, videos, sound, etc.296It is like your paper notebook but online.297You can find it wherever you are by going on the online portal.298It's also possible to share this notebook.299If you share it with someone, this person will be able to go in your OneNote, your pages, your sections,300see the information that you add and will be able to add information as well,301simultaneously if you want to.302It's a quick wait to share information, after a meeting for example.303Let's go back to our PowerPoint.304OneDrive and SharePoint:305OneDrive is for files, tools and shared documents306and SharePoint is for synchronization of the file server in the company's Internet.307In Office Online we have Word for emails and long documents creation,308Excel for calculation, showing value results, data management and analysis,309PowerPoint, the presentation maker,310and OneNote that we saw before.311A summary of all of this:312makes remote working easier,313provides access at any time,314enables document modification with several people315at different times and simultaneously.316If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them right now.317If you do not, I thank you for being here today.318Make a good use of what you learned today.319Have a good day.

Discover the note taking app,"Hello everyone,Welcome to this online session called:Discover the Note Taking App: OneNote.My name is Dina and I will be your trainer today.First be advisedthat this webinar is being recorded andyou will have the opportunity to view itsoon after on our MOOC platform.And now, before I start the presentationand in order to ensure that it runs smoothly, it is important you listen to the followinginstructions carefully.The first one is: If you're using a phone, please do nottake call waiting or a second call asthe music on hold will start playing andwe will no longer be able to hear oneanother. The second one is: On your endmake sure to turn the microphone off byswitching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know, some of you may beworking in an open space environment; Sothose are really just cautionarymeasures to avoid unpredictable orunwanted background noise.The third and last one is: Please remember to keep yourcomputer screen active at all times bywiggling the mouse every now and then.  Itis very important you do not let your PCgo into sleep mode as this will causethe interruption of the video and youwill find yourself kicked out of thisonline session.  The inconvenience here isthat you will have to repeat the loginsteps all over again to get back in it!So let's avoid that!  All right.  First ofall, I've been using OneNote for almost ayear now. It has become my favorite tool.  I useit in my personal and my work life. It isa very user-friendly application andthis is why I find it very neat! So now,this is what we're going to cover overthe 45-minute session: The idea beingthat we are going to create a brand newwhat is OneNote and we'll seewhat it can do; Then after creating thatorganize it into different sections; Weare going to use the search feature withthe tag action items as to create ""To-Do""lists and prioritize those actions aswell.  And then, we are going to see how tostore securely this OneNote notebook inour OneDrive. The idea is to be able touse the application fully and so it isbest to learn how to save your notes inthe Cloud space so you can access fromany device; and also, to share thiscolleagues or friends... or family members... And collaborate on those notes together.So the objectives here are to discoverhow to centralize our notes with onesingle tool and to efficiently use theapplication's features and other tools.Now, let's begin! So what is ""OneNote""? Itbasically is your very own digitalideas a million things to do or amillion things to remember...  Well,OneNote is the perfect app for capturingpretty much everything. In technicalterms: It is a computer program forfree-form information gathering andmulti-user collaboration.  It can also gatherusers' notes (whether they arehandwritten or typed) drawings, screenclippings and audio commentaries. At thesame time, notes can be shared with otherOneNote users over the internet or aspecific network.  So what can you do withOneNote? Well, you can do the following:You can type or dictate notes... and/or recordaudio on your laptop, for instance.You can also sketch or write ideas onyour tablet; Add pictures from your phoneor find notes instantly; You can freelymove those notes around the page whichis very convenient; And you can organizethose pages into sections and keep yoursections in one or more notebooks. Butmost of all, you can switch devices andpick up right where you left off and ofcourse, share your notebooks with others; This way you can all view and contribute atthe same time, on the same items. Allright... So let's start using OneNote! Firstof all, it has a consistent interfacethat works the same on Windows Mac iOSand Android. You can sign in with yourpersonal Microsoft account or theaccount you use for work or school. Andthis is the part where I'm going tolaunch my Google Chrome browser to show you how to sign in to your Microsoftaccount. So I'm going to go right ahead andclick on Show Taskbar...  And at the bottom,I can locate my Google Chrome browser. I'm going to launch the page and under theGoogle search bar,  I'm going to just type in""Office 365""... and here you go... ""Office 365Login | Microsoft Office"" is the link Iwant.  I select it.  I'm going to sign inwith a ""Demo account"" under the name ofOliver Lodge.  I'm going to validate thispassword right now... And yes, I wish tostay signed in!  Now that I am in myMicrosoft account, on the upper rightcorner, appears the initials ""O.L."" forOliver Lodge as an avatar, my help button,my star wheel (if I wish to adjust thesettings) the notifications button... Andthen, on the far left, I can go to my ""AppLaunch"".  I can launch my OneNote from here or Ican just go to the tiles locatedhorizontally, on the main page. And I'mgoing to click on OneNote. Once I'm here,there's a purple button ""+ Newcreate a new notebook but we're going to dothis with the OneNote 2016 version on mydesktop, so I'm not going to click on that.Under the ""Recent"", right here, I can seethe recent activity... All the notebooksthat were open recently by Oliver Lodge...Under the ""Pinned"", his favorite notebook...Under ""My notebooks"", all the notebooks hecreated himself; he's the author of thesewith him; and then under ""Discover"", thoseare just suggestions... So I'm going to goback to the pinned one and I'm going tolaunch that one notebook online: ""trainer@teachoip"".The title will appearat the center, on top... Right there!  Andalso the author name again with the nameof that notebook.  I can also see the nameof the notebook, right here.  This is your""More Notebooks"" suggestions, ones I'verecently opened; I can see more notebooksby clicking at the bottom which takes meto a page with others suggestedI'm going to close this tab back... I'mgoing back to my notebookSo we saw we could see other notebooksfrom here, we can click back on thelayout is different from the regularinterface we had on OneNote 2016, on ourdesktop; The only difference is thesections are laid out vertically on thefar left with the ""+ Section"" buttonappearing at the bottom, here... And the""+ Pages"" right next to it, with thatvertical pane, as well...  And then the whitearea would be the page content.So you have your ribbon appearing on thefar right, as usual online all yourapplications when you open them theaccount user name appears on the topright: Oliver Lodge with the share button andthe notification button. So... if we were tolook at this ribbon, automatically we areon our ""Home"" tab. ""Home"" tab is where most of the used commands appear... So we haveour ""Undo"" / ""Redo"" button, the ""Clipboard"" the formatting group items up to here... Withdifferent ""Styles"" offered for the ""Heading""the ""Title"", ""Citations"" and so on... You gotyour ""Tags"" button and your spell check andthe ""Dictation"" button (which does notexist on OneNote 2016)... The version onlinehas it; And the latest Windows 10version of OneNote has it, as well.  Soagain, OneNote 2016 will no longer beupdated; Microsoft decided to come upwith a new version that resembles theone online. Except that I like bothversions.  And mainly... OneNote 2016, for me,is more inclusive...  But there are newfeatures in the version online andWindows 10 that I like; So, I chose todownload both versions and pin them bothto my taskbar so that I can swap back andforth when needed. So, let's continue!  If Igo to the file, I get to the backstage ofOneNote and there, are four tabs: I canprint from here, I can share with otherpeople by clicking on the ""Share"" buttonhere, online... And of course, you canstill insert you know: tables, files,pictures, links, even an ""Audio"" of youremojis and your ""Meeting Details"", as well...with stickers.  You can draw and here arethe tools to draw with...  And we'll getback to those features on OneNote 2016.So let me get back to the ""Home"" page...Let me start by selecting a new section inthis notebook.  So, I'm just going to create anew one real fast, for the online version...So ""New 400"" appeared right here and I seethis color has been used already... So I'mgoing to pick a new one... Uhm...  Section color...  Let'sgo with orange!  All right.  So ""New 400"" ishere.  Let's say I wanted to be rightunder ""Quick Notes""... So, it's now appearingat the bottom...  And automatically, when youcreate a new section, you will noticethere's a new ""Untitled Page""that automatically appears.  So, I'm going to press on that""+ Page"" and add more pages, if I want to...And then, I'm going to go here... And this page,I'm just going to give it the title""Dictation"" because this is the firstfeature I want to use; I'm going to""Dictate"" button on the far right.  I'mgoing to adjust the language to ""English(US)"".   I'm going to click on that button and assoon as I do that, the machine will starttyping for me... ""Anything I say, will appearon this page... I'm trying to create aparagraph so that I can demonstrate thenext feature which is called the""Immersive Reader, period."" And there youhave it.  I have a whole text, I'm going topress here.So, I deactivated the microphone.  Now ofcourse, I can use any of those featuresright here for formatting; I could alsochange the font if I wanted to...  I can usethe format painter and copy it over toanother line if I wanted to... There, youhave it!And I can increase the indentation, I canadd spaces between lines, just like youwould in Microsoft Word.  I'm going to undothis part and I can highlight all ofthat and clear the formatting instantly.So now, we are going to see, as well... theother feature is under the ""View"" tab.I'm going to the ""Immersive Reader"" and thisis pretty amazing!First of all you can adjust how theOneNote is going to read your text inthat page.  You can adjust the voice speed.You can choose a ""Male"" voice instead, ifyou prefer...  And then, you can press ""Play"".So you can't hear it because I'm doingthis presentation online...  I cannot shareboth audios, unfortunately!  Obviously, Ipicked the speed that was too fast...  It isa male voice that's reading aloud thewords that were highlighted just beforeyou, at that level...  So, I can go back andadjust it to being one and I can alsoadjust the text, if I want to read at thesame time...  I want to put that text.  Well,this size, should do!  And then, I can increasethe spacing between the words, if Iwanted to...  I can change the font fromthis to ""Calibri"" or ""Sitka"", again...  And Ican change the ""Themes""...  The background isnow yellow...  It's offering me more colorsover here.So the ""Grammar"" options, it can highlightthe ""Verbs"" in a different color.  So let'sactivate this portion...  So now you can seeany verb is highlighted in red. Now I cango to the ""Reading Preferences"".  I canfocus three lines at a time, if I wantedto...  Or just one line at a time...  And goback to this one, if I want to see the wholeparagraph...  And I can instantly change andtranslate this paragraph to Spanish.Let's say so...  Oops!  I went too fast.Going back to ""Spanish from Spain""... and I'mgoing to click on document,right here.  So Imade those adjustments and now I canpress the ""Play"" button.""Haga clic en ese boton y tan pronto como...""Now, I don't speak Spanish too well.But I'm trying to repeat what I justheard...  What you couldn't hear! But this isa fantastic way to improve language learning skills...  Not only you can translate your textinstantly but then you can practice howyou enunciate those words by selectingthe language of a native speaker...  Even ifit's a robot that's speaking, it'sactually very close to the real thing! Sothis is why I love this ""Dictation"" buttonand the ""Immersive Reader"".  So I'm going togo back.  We're done with the onlineversion! The other thing I could show youhere, (real fast) is wherever you're typingmanually...  I can type over here...  Or overhere...  I'm putting some gibberish items...Basically, you notice I have now fourmodules that I can also resize, if Iwanted to...  I can move them around likemagnets on a fridge, so that's veryconvenient! I've just copied one over(real fast) here...  So I can movethem around anyway I want and each ofthose modules of course, I can highlightand change the formatting, as I go along.So that's also very practical.  You canfreely move your notes around the page!So let me go back now to my ""Taskbar""... This is to  show you those are the two iconsI have; If I hover over this one: 'OneNote'is the latest version, the one you haveonline; And then ""OneNote 2016"" is theolder version but this is the one we'regoing to work with because it has far morefeatures, as well.  So let me launchOneNote 2016. Right away, you see that theribbon is far larger on the upper rightside.  You have the option of collapsingthe ribbon if you want; You can alsohide that ribbon; You can bring it back byshowing just the tabs or you can bringit back the way it was (with the commands)and then, you can go to the file section.That's the backstage to your OneNote. Yousee...  You have far more tabs around here.You can open a ""New"" notebook fromhere...  ""Open"" existing ones...  You can print...  Soyou can have a ""Print Preview"", as well.From here, you can ""Share with People"", youcan ""Share with Meeting"", ""Move"" notebooksand you can also export a ""Page"" of yourOutlook...  ""Send as Attachment""...  ""Send as PDF""...  ""Send to Word"", straight to Word docwith the contents of any page you filledin... Then you can also ""Send to Blog"".  Thishere, the ""Account"", is where you would doyour ""Office Updates"".  Now, be very careful!The last update I did, took away myOneNote 2016 and left me with a newversion without warning me...  But if you dogo to the Microsoft Office Support page, youcan find the download for OneNote 2016again and you will recover all the stuffyou had before.  So I'm going back tothe ""Home"" page.You have your ""Clipboard"" section...  yourbasic text formatting with the ""Styles""...  Wewill see the ""Tags"" section and how toEmail a page and the ""Meeting Details"".Right now, as you see, this is still thesame notebook I've opened...It's called ""trainer @teachoip"".  Remember, Ihad added a section called ""New 400"".I added some pages. I called one: ""Dictation"".  Those are the notes I just took online...You can understandnow that anything I do... If I were toshare this notebook with anyone,provided that I have saved it under myCloud space, under my OneDrive: my""personal"" or my ""business"" OneDrive... Anyelement I'm sharing with someone else,any modification I'm doing on the onlineversion, or on the desktop, issynchronized in real time.  So you're notgoing to lose any of your elements; Even ifthe internet stopped, this is theonly time where the elements are notsynchronized.  Don't worry!  You just haveto wait for the Internet to get back andeverything will get synchronized againwith the elements online. Ok.  So now, wesaid we're going to create a ""Newdo that, I always like to show the topsection. Right over here, is your ""QuickAccess Toolbar""... Those are things I liketo put in, immediately: The ""Undo""/""Redo""...  The ""Print""...  The ""Print Preview""...My ""FavoriteHighlighter 1""...  And somewhere in here, there's a ""Screen Clipping""...  I can right-clickon any button I like...  And I can addto ""Quick Access Toolbar"".  And now, it'sappearing here.  Why do I like this button?Well, this is my presentation... Let's sayI just want to highlight this portionhere...  I can put it on this page and look!What's amazing about OneNote, it cansearch text within an image!  So if I wereto type ""consistent interface"" or even a wholesentence ...Do you notice that? Within a picture, Ijust did a screenshot of something on myPowerPoint and it recognizes the textinstantly!  ""consistent interface"" is nowhighlighted. So if I had that word orthat sentence in any of my sections orother notebooks, it would be displayed under this vertical pane.  The""Search"" engine is fantastic!  Now let'sgo ahead and create that fresh notebook.I'm now clicking on the drop-down menu,under this notebook called""traine@teachoip"" and I can click righthere to say add notebook.  Wait...  Iforgot to let you know about the ""Pinbetween all your notebooks.  If you needto work with all of them at the sametime.  You can click on any of them andswitch...  But if you wish to havefull view again, you just click back onthat pin...  And instead, now I'm just going to clickon ""Add Notebook"".  It's going to take me tothe ""New"" tab, instantly.  I have the optionof saving my notebook directly under myCloud space which would be the idealspot...  If I want to actually have afull use of my OneNote application.  But for this demonstration, I'm going tosave it under my desktop which is thelocal area of my PC, meaning that I canonly access that notebook with that samePC.  And then, we'll see how to move thatspace OneDrive.  So let me call this one""Dina Family Notebook 101"".  I'm going to press ""Create Notebook"".  So now...  There you have it!  The nameof my notebook appears here; Automatically, I have a ""New Section 1"".I'm going to create 5 more... Maybe, 6 willdo.  I go to the first one and I willcall it ""Shopping List"".  The next one I'llcall ""Gardening"".  The idea is that I willbe sharing a personal notebook with myfamily members as an example.  And then,""Vacation Ideas""...  Countries: ""Canada""... Pick anothercountry...  I wish to visit ""Mexico"" and awhole continent: ""Europe"". Okay.  So why did Icreate those sections? Well, first of all,I can move the sections aroundby a ""drag and drop"", no problem.  Now if Iwant to put more structure in myorganization, I should put all those""Vacation Ideas"" with my countries.  And here, Ican go to the far right of Europe, forinstance, right-click on Europe...  Go to""New Section Group"" and that new section group, I'll give it a name: ""Summer Family Vacation"".And then I can just take the section: ""Vacation Ideas ""...  Drag and drop itunderneath and go back. So vacation ideas...  I select ""Summer Family Vacation""...  It goesunderneath that...  ""Canada"" under that...""Mexico"" and ""Europe""...  So now I have asection which is called... Right here,underneath the title of ""Dina Family Notebook""...""Summer Family Vacation"".Underneath it, I got ""Vacation Ideas"",""Canada"", ""Mexico"", ""Europe"".  Each of those sections has an ""Untitled Page"".  Okay.  So Ihave organized my ""Summer Family Vacation"".  I'm going to go back.  Now let's work on that""Shopping List"" section...I wish to add more pagesto the ""Shopping List"", so let's add about6...  The first one, I'm going to call it...  Well,""Birthday Shopping List"".  Here, I'm going toright-click on the next oneand give it a name: ""Cake Ideas""...  And thisone, I will rename it ""Food""...  ""Beverages""...""Activities""...  And the last one, ""Budget"". Now, just to put a structure as well under my""Shopping List""...  As you see, I have ""Birthday Shopping List"", ""Cake Ideas"", ""Food"", ""Beverages"",""Activities""...  Well, these 4 things shouldgo under ""Birthday Shopping List"".  So Ican either go and highlight ""Cake Ideas"" and ""Make a Subpage""...  Or I can manuallydrag food to the right...  So now I have the4 items as a subgroup.  And you willnotice right here, I can expand or collapse my list... Thereyou go!  So this is one way to structureyour pages.  I'm going to go back underthose...  Under ""Cake Ideas"", I'm going to put ""FLAVORS""...  So ""Chocolate""...  ""Vanilla""...""Strawberries""...""Caramel"".  All right.  So I put some flavorsand now I'm going to the ""Food"" sectionI'm going to make quickly a list for ""Food""...""Pizza""...""Sandwiches""...   ""Popcorn""...  ""Popsicles""...  I'm running out of ideas...  So let memove on to ""Beverages"", and here we go ...Over here, I'm going to type ""Apple Juice""...""Orange Juice""... ""Lemonade"" and ""Soda"".  For the ""Activities"", I'll pick 2 things.  Well, a""DJ"" which I will let my son take care of...  And then a ""Clown"" for my seven-year-olddaughter, let's say...  So now that I haveput in the items under each category, Iwant to make a To-Do list.  So I caneither highlight the words and press the ""To Do Tag""...A check box automatically appears...  I canremove this check box by going againunder the ""Tags"" group and then, at the very bottom, I'm going to make this a shortcut...Add to ""Quick Access Toolbar"".  Here, on on the top-right corner, it appears.  So I can remove thistag and instead maybe customize it.  The point here is to put a general ""To Do Tag"".And then I can specify...  These 2 for instance are my actiontags.  I'm going to customize a tag, soI'll know from this list which items Iam supposed to get.  So let me go to thenew tag, I'm going to type in a ""#""...Let me make sure I did this right...  ""#"" (hashtag"")...  Here we go...""Dina""... ""Actions""... (""# Dina Actions""), we'll call that one.  And then here,I'll just change the ""Tag"" and put a ""Star""instead...  And make it ""bright green"" so I canlocate it faster!All right.  There you go.  Now these2 items that I highlighted,I'm going to change them to beexactly my data actions tag...  So now I cando this for the ""Beverages"" or for the""Activities""...  Let's say I'm getting the""Clown""...""#Dina Actions""...  There you go.Oops.  Let me undo this.Let's do first a regular ""To Do Tag"".And then, I will specify that the ""Clown""...I'm going to take care of him...  And then,the beverages...  Let's say I'm in charge ofthe ""Lemonade""... Oops.  Again I keepforgetting the regular ""To Do Tag"" for everyone.And for me, I'm going to add a special ""Tag""to remember to get those items, myself.There you go.  So the whole idea here isto be able to do a quick ""Find Tags"" search.All right.  So before you...  It took afew seconds for all my notebooks tosynchronize since I have 3applications open: the one online, theversion that I have opened right now andthe Windows 10.  So ""#Dina Actions"" appearon top again because I put the ""hashtag""before my ""name""... Now, it appears on the verytop of the list, up here!  So it's showing""#Dina Actions"" first...  Then it's showing thecategory ""To Do"" which is the othercategory for the rest of the membersof the family...  All the other items thatstill need to be purchased by them.Here, I could have filtered my ""Search""with these different possibilities...  Andif it doesn't work right away, you alwayshave the ""Refresh Results"" button.Remember, it's a matter of letting the notebook synchronize first.And then, the convenient part is thatI can ""Create Summary Page"".  Now theother cool thing is for each of those items, Icould also add an ""Outlook Tasks""...  But I'mgoing to put first...  ""Apple Juice""...I'm going to set that for ""Tomorrow""...The ""Strawberries"" for ""This Week""...  The ""DJ""for ""Next Week""...  But I also have now thepossibility of opening these tasks inOutlook.  So let's say, for the ""DJ"", I wantmy husband or I'm sorry my son to takecare of that...  So ""Subject:""...  ""DJ""...  I can forwardthis task or assign this task to my son...Let's say his name is ""Philippe"", just forthe purpose of this presentation...  And Imake sure it kicks in...  Why isn't itkicking in? He should be in the address-book...Hold on...  So of course I'm using a ""Demo""name again...  So, here we go.  Well, It took a fewseconds...  All right.  Now I can assign thisparticular task to ""Philippe Houyau""...  I cansee the status for this task andfollow the progress of thistask...  So I can include a due date, I canalso adjust the priority  to ""HighImportance""... And then just sendthat message to ""Philippe Houyau"".  This isone way.  The other way,  I could havetaken this list of items and email it to myself...  So nowwhen I click on that ""Email Page"" iconon the ribbon, up here...Okay.  It took a few seconds...See, the list appears within the textarea of the email...  And now, I could just sendit to my personal email, for instance.All right.  So now: ""#Dina Actions""... I send thislist to myself.  So this way when I get it,I can start purchasing those items and Ican check them off as I go along.All right.  Or I could have just simplydownloaded the OneNote App on my phoneor my tablet, and then check off directly theitems from there.  That's anotherway...  I'm not going to send this.  That wasjust to demonstrate...  I'm going to close this.Now back to the OneNoteinterface...  You saw I can add ""Outlook Tasks"";I can open them within the Outlookapplication itself.  And now the other option, isthe ""Meeting Details""...  This is another thing we can add that actually has nothing to do withthe ""Shopping List""...   So let meopen a ""New Section""...  ""All the otherfeatures""...  Now I'm just going to show you...  IfI were using this professionally, I couldgo to the ""Meeting Details""...  So I alreadyprogrammed a meeting where I sent theinvite to my colleagues... I'm going tolocate that invite...  It was meant to befor tomorrow and it's called ""BusinessTravel Procedures"".  That's the one.  I caninsert the details that I sent to themwhich was an email basically saying""Hello everyone...""  First I locatethe email...  So those are the email details...Here, I have the list of the participantswhich basically shows the people I'veinvited in my email...I have sent them 2 attachments and asmall text which is...  ""Our MeetingObjectives""...  If I click here, I go straightto that email invite...  And I can see thedetails within that email...  And there, yougo!  You can see the people I've invited...(who appeared on the list of participants)...  I can checkthem off the day of the meeting andbasically, the text with a print screen.All right.  So this is what's so coolabout the ""Meeting Details""...  It's actuallysomething that you can locate in yourOutlook.  Now, I'm going to show my Taskbar...Let's open it up!Okay so back to normal...  I've launchedmy Outlook and this is the""OneNote"" button that I wanted to show you.I could click on this button fromOutlook and decide to add the details of an email message within OneNote.  So here it says to ""Pick asection or a page in which to put thee-mail""...  I could then go to my notebook,""All the other features"" and I can pick thatsection...  And as you see, under my ""All theother features"" section, it added the email message I selected from my Outlook inbox within my notebook,under the section I wanted.  So this iswhat you can do with Outlook, as well.Let me go back to Outlook.So I'm on the section ""All the other features"".I'm going to addanother page.  Let's put a few more...   So nowlet's go to the ""Sketching"" part.First, I can insert a file...  So letme go ahead and insert a PowerPoint file...Let's see... It would be under my ""DemoUploads""...  Which one should I take?""Snapshot Calendar..."" is a word.doc...  Well, let's startwith the Word.doc first beforeI go to the PowerPoint.  What you haveto understand is that OneNote isintegrated with the Office Suite and itworks beautifully with Word, PowerPoint,and Excel.  You can also insert PDF orwhatever web apps...  So let me go and approvethis date...  Press okay...  So this is a calendarsnapshot that I'm incorporating into myOneNote... I should have closed the other apps, Ithink I have too many things open...  Okay.So, the snapshot appeared...  You see...The printout instantly came into to myOneNote...  Let me close theseother panes right now.  All right.  So nowif I want to start drawing on thispicture, let's say...  As you can see, youhave the ""Lasso Select"",  the ""Panning Hand"", the ""Eraser""...And a choice of ""Highlighters and Pens""...I can also change the color andthickness by clicking here... Let mestart  with this ""red pen""...  Let's sayI want to mark some calendar dates withan ""X""...  Here, I can write ""vacation""...  I'm goingto handwrite which is not very easyto do with the mouse(instead of a digital pen)...  So let's dothis and see if it will recognize theword...  Okay.  Here it goes.You will notice on the ribbon,on the far right, it will switch ""Ink toText""...  And there you go.   I'm going to press""Escape"" for a minute... The word ""vacation""just appeared and it's amazing!  I canalso go back to my handwritten note andif I asked the ""Search"" engine over hereto locate any word or ""vacation"" on allIt will locate it... And it tells me right away...Well,  the ""Summer family Vacation""tab has the word vacationin it...  But it's also highlighting (righthere) the handwritten word ""vacation"".  So the search field recognizes texton images, handwritten text, as well.  Thisis how powerful OneNote search engine is!That's that as far as the ""Sketching and Drawing"" are concerned.  Now if I want to use theeraser I can quickly erase that way.  Let'ssay I started scribbling over here, withthis ""green pen""...  All right.  So I could do an""x"" and a ""y"" here...  Now I can use the insert""Insert Space"" to move objects...  So I've moved the ""X""without disturbing the space between""vacation"" and ""X""...  You could do that again.So this is another possibility. And now,back to the ""Insert"" tab...  Let me go to another""Untitled Page""...All Right. PowerPoint...  So you can alsoinsert the printout of a PowerPoint presentation.Let me do this and see the difference.  Let's pick ""Currency symbols"" and ""Insert Printout"".So now there's the printout of all theslides in that PowerPoint.  The otherthing you can do is the ""Audio"" portion.So I can go to my ribbon, I can ""RecordAudio"" or I can ""Record Video"".  Of courseyou won't be able to hear back theaudio but let me demonstrate...  So this iswhat the icon appears like...  I can typeanything I want and then I can press""Stop""...  Whatever I just said while I was typing...I can see the playback and hear it sowhen I press...(Sorry, I have to select it)...When I press ""Play"", I can hear myself...  Andanything that's highlighted in grey, it'srepeating what I've typed... So that sums upthe audio portion.  And now, I can alsogo back to my ""Insert"" tab...  I can also goto a browser, for instance..  Well, of course,you can add pictures and so on...  We'veseen the ""Screen Clipping"" earlier...  But I'mgoing to go to my browser, go to a YouTubepage and just select a video.So YouTube...  Let me type ""OneNote""... Let'spick this one...  I have to let the ad run firstI think...  In the meantime, I'mselecting ""Share""...  Then ""Copy"" the link and thenI'm going back to my OneNote again topaste that link.  Sorry, I'm havingtrouble with my mouse...  And so, I copypaste the link and I have the option toplay the video right from here, in that screen size...I won't be able to view it in full-size from here...But if I choose to, I can just click onthe link to get back to the browser andwatch the video on YouTube, itself.That's for the audio and inserting avideo within OneNote.  Now if I wantedto share this notebook with other people...I could press ""Share with People"" and I cantype in the name of any people I want...Well, I've done it earlier...  So ""Maxime Démo""...  I am already sharingwith ""Maxime Démo""...  I am also sharing with""Oliver Lodge"" and ""Laurent Balardy"" and asyou can see, ""Maxime Démo"" is an owner... ""OliverLodge"" is also an owner... And ""Laurent Balardy""can edit.  So those are thepermissions I granted.  I can write apersonal message before sending the linkto them... And over here, I can switch between""Can Edit"" and ""Can View"" beforeI actually give them the sharing optionSo I can type in another email...  Let's say""Lisa Elliot"", for the demonstration...  I'mgoing to choose: Lisa ""Can View""... Then press ""Share"".And of course, the user is required tosign in before accessing document.  That'sthat.  So when Lisa is available and whenshe accepts it her name will appearright here, with her avatar.  That's all regarding the ""Sharing"" demonstration.Now, I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.So we saw how to create a notebook.  Wesaw that it automatically saves andsyncs our notes as we work.  We can typeinformation anywhere and insert it fromother apps and web pages.  We can takehandwritten notes or draw our ideas.  Wecan use the highlighting and tags foreasy follow-up.  And we can share ourthe same items.  And if we do save ourmeans under our personal OneDrive or ourbusiness OneDrive, we can access thoseYou got it.  So taking notes in OneNote:You can take the notes the way you want.You can type them write them converthandwritten notes to text and evenrecord audio notes.  You can add picturesfiles and videos to your notes to createinteractive notebooks.  You can alsocreate as many pages and sections andthose notes to get them to look just theway you want.  And you can also apply abackground color to your OneNote pagesto change their appearance and make yourgoing to quickly backtrack and go on myOneNote...  And here you go...  Over here,under ""View"", on the ribbon, I can choose to add""Grid"" or maybe just the typical ""RuleLines"", smaller ones if I wanted...  And righton the left of it, the color page.  So ofcourse, those are extremely light...  Let'ssee...  Here you go.  I applied the backgroundcolor.  So there's a lot of things you cando with OneNote and this is why it's aneat application!  Let me backtrackagain to my PowerPoint presentation.  So Ican insert and format the table inOneNote to visually organize information.Let me go back to my OneNote.  This is theportion I left out...  We can go to the""Shopping List"" again, under ""Budget"" and inhere,  I can insert a table just like inWord or PowerPoint. I'm going to highlight4 columns and pick 3 rows... Then I'mgoing to expand the ""Birthday Shopping List""to remember the items I had to purchasefor my budget.  So ""Cake, ""Food"", ""Beverages"",""Activities""...  Let's say, for the ""Cake"": Iwanted to spend 85, the ""Food"": 150,""Beverages"": 80...  And then,""Activities"": 250...  I ended upspending only 50 for the ""Cake"", 125for the ""Food""... ""Beverages"": 100 and then forthe ""Activities"" I went all out: 350.  Nowbecause I inserted a table you willnotice I was on my ""Home"" page and it took me straight to the ""Layout"" tab, under ""Table Tools""...  And it'soffering to convert my table to an Excelspreadsheet...  So I'm going to click onthat.  It's now downloading the app:  TheExcel spreadsheet into OneNote app...  Andif I go to edit and I right-click, here.It has already launched the Excelspreadsheet; my data is included inthat spreadsheet...  And now I have theoption to go to ""Insert"" tab within Excel andadd a recommended chart, for instance...I'll just pick a basic one...  And when I dosave that spreadsheet, it willactually be saved within OneNote.  I'm goingto close this window.  Let's give it a fewseconds... This chart should appear inmy OneNote.Well, everything is slow this evening.All right.  So here it is.   I'm closing that.So now the chart has appeared within myOneNote.  And if I do again aright-click, my option here is to selectwhat to display...  And in there, I'm justgoing to uncheck: ""Display Everything"", ""Sheet1""...  And select just ""Chart1""...  So the ideahere for my budget is  that I want to see apretty chart in my OneNote...  And next year,I'll know how to handle my budget better.That was the last part of the exercise.I'm going back to my PowerPoint.  So youcan draw and sketch in OneNote to bringyour notes to life.  You can insert shapeslike a circle, triangle, or rectangle, oreven draw shapes with your finger, pen, ormouse, and OneNote will automaticallyclean them up for you.  You can share andstay organized in OneNote.  It can helpyou find notes no matter where they are.Whether you like a lot of structure, orjust a little, OneNote helps you organizeyour notebook exactly the way you want.You can share and sync in OneNote.  You canshare a page or your entire notebook tocollaborate with others.  You can usepasswords to protect notebook sectionsyou want to keep private.  You can set upyour mobile apps.

Creating Business Solutions with SalesTim,"In this video, we will see how to provide new Business Solutions for your company and all your employees.We will therefore create ready-to-use, pre-configured teams: a list of conversational channels, user guides and ""Planners"" with pre-defined tasks. All will be available in a catalog of solutions dedicated to your Company. With all this, you will be able to start working immediately.To illustrate this, I will use a concrete case where we will prepare a business solution to help salespersons collaborate to make a business proposal.In Microsoft Teams, I want to replicate this team which enables me to organize the creation of business proposals. This team includes defined channels on the different topics of conversation,tabs containing internal sites and a planner with the tasks to be performed for each business proposal.So, I'm going to create a new business solution from this team. To begin with, as an administrator, I go to the “Catalog” tab of SalesTimand access the list of Business Solutions available to the company, which I choose to enable or disable.To make a new business solution available, I select ""Create"".Then I choose the team that will be my template. I choose the team we talked about before.I then define the name of my business solution which will appear in the company catalog.  Then, the description that users will see and the elements I want to replicate: apps, tabs, settings, and if I want, members.Note that websites, tabs and planners will be pre-configured.I then choose the default name of all teams,I choose a naming convention.For example, here, I will add ""- Sales"" to distinguish all the teams created from this business solution.I If I want, I can do the same for the different elements like the emails, the descriptionand the welcome message.I choose whether or not to appoint an owner.I can look for an owner by name directly in the company directory.The owner will be notified of a new request by email and will have to validate or not the creation in the SalesTim application.I choose to set up audience targeting or not. We will see this in a second video.Then, I set the security setting; All these settings will be permanent.I choose whether I want the team to be private or public; if I choose “private”, all teams will be private and remain so. I add permanent owners or permanent members.In his case, I can add a legal person who must monitor sales as a permanent member. Finally, I determine the emails that are sent to owners: After the creation,one week later, two weeks later, to help them promote the adoption of this new business solution. I create the new template and make it available to my company.I then go to the homepage as an end-user,I choose to create a new team.I select the business solution,launch the creationand, a few seconds later, I discover the team with the list of channels,tabsand a ready-to-use planner.You can create an unlimited number of business solutions to meet all your company’s needs and use Microsoft Teams to be effective in your daily teamwork.You can create teams to manage projects, recruitments, sales, or even to structure your teams by department.",video see provid new busi solut compani employeesw therefor creat readytous preconfigur team list convers channel user guid planner predefin task avail catalog solut dedic compani abl start work immediatelyto illustr use concret case prepar busi solut help salesperson collabor make busi proposalin microsoft team want replic team enabl organ creation busi propos team includ defin channel differ topic conversationtab contain intern site planner task perform busi proposalso im go creat new busi solut team begin administr go catalog tab salestimand access list busi solut avail compani choos enabl disableto make new busi solut avail select createthen choos team templat choos team talk beforei defin name busi solut appear compani catalog descript user see element want replic app tab set want membersnot websit tab planner preconfiguredi choos default name teamsi choos name conventionfor exampl add sale distinguish team creat busi solutioni want differ element like email descriptionand welcom messagei choos whether appoint owneri look owner name directli compani directoryth owner notifi new request email valid creation salestim applicationi choos set audienc target see second videothen set secur set set permanenti choos whether want team privat public choos privat team privat remain add perman owner perman membersin case add legal person must monitor sale perman member final determin email sent owner creationon week later two week later help promot adopt new busi solut creat new templat make avail companyi go homepag enduseri choos creat new teami select busi solutionlaunch creationand second later discov team list channelstabsand readytous plannery creat unlimit number busi solut meet compani need use microsoft team effect daili teamworky creat team manag project recruit sale even structur team depart
"Advanced Configuration: Naming Convention, Audience and Security","Now that you have seen how to set up Business Solutions in SalesTim, we will focus on advanced options. For example, you want to set up an advanced and differentiated naming convention depending on team templates.Or, you would like to appoint permanent members or owners for all teams created from a template. Or, you want to target the audience for which the team template is intended.We will see how to do this in this tutorial.As explained in the 1st tutorial, I create a new business solution.First of all, on the Naming Convention, I have the option to add a prefix, a suffix or any element of the user’s profile, the Azure AD profile.For example, I want to create a template for the sales department: in the naming convention, I want to indicate the country and the fact that this team is dedicated to the sales department. The country is displayed in the user profile so I will indicate it as an automatic value added to the creation. This will therefore include the country indicated in the user profile of the person making the request. I will then add at the end “- Sales Dep”to indicate that the profile is associated to the sales department. I can then do the same for all the elements, whether it is the description or the welcome message.This way, I can make sure that all the elements are created automatically and take all the requester’s information. If you wish to go further, you can refer to the documentation which indicates all the possibilities or contact us directly.This solution is only intended for sales departments. I would like to ensure that it appears only for people who have a sales function. Indeed, users in the operations or HR departments have no interest in seeing this. So, I go to the ""Audience Targeting"" section. I can thus set up from any data in a given user profile whether or not this business solution will be displayed. I enter here. I enter here the fact that this solution will only be available to users who have a sales function.To go further on audience targeting, you can refer to the documentation and/or contact us directly.Finally, about security, I want to make sure that all these teams are private and that the sales manager or someone from the IT management is a member of each created team linked with this template.I will therefore add them as permanent members by entering their first and last names.If this person changes position or leaves the company, I simply remove this person from the template and replace them with the new one.This new person will then be added to all the teams that were previously created from this template.I then save the business solution and make it available to users in the catalog.I create a new team with this solution,select it,enter the nameand then I find that the different elements are created automatically.I then start creating the teamand, a few minutes later, here I am with all the elements: a team with the right naming convention, owners and permanent members, the list of channels, tabs, etc.You have seen here a detailed example with a particular use case scenario about the sales department.The possibilities are unlimited! For your department teams (Sales, HR, Marketing, etc.) or for your teams dedicated to projects, sales management, launching of new products, etc. It's up to you!",seen set busi solut salestim focu advanc option exampl want set advanc differenti name convent depend team templatesor would like appoint perman member owner team creat templat want target audienc team templat intendedw see tutoriala explain 1st tutori creat new busi solutionfirst name convent option add prefix suffix element user profil azur ad profilefor exampl want creat templat sale depart name convent want indic countri fact team dedic sale depart countri display user profil indic automat valu ad creation therefor includ countri indic user profil person make request add end sale depto indic profil associ sale depart element whether descript welcom messagethi way make sure element creat automat take request inform wish go refer document indic possibl contact us directlythi solut intend sale depart would like ensur appear peopl sale function inde user oper hr depart interest see go audienc target section thu set data given user profil whether busi solut display enter enter fact solut avail user sale functionto go audienc target refer document andor contact us directlyfin secur want make sure team privat sale manag someon manag member creat team link templatei therefor add perman member enter first last namesif person chang posit leav compani simpli remov person templat replac new onethi new person ad team previous creat templatei save busi solut make avail user catalog creat new team solutionselect itent nameand find differ element creat automaticallyi start creat teamand minut later element team right name convent owner perman member list channel tab etcyou seen detail exampl particular use case scenario sale departmentth possibl unlimit depart team sale hr market etc team dedic project sale manag launch new product etc
SalesTim: adoption and governance driving force for Microsoft Teams,"Good morning and welcome! Do you wonder how to facilitate the adoption and governance of Microsoft Teams for the different departments within your company? This is what SalesTim is all about.In order to enable effective teamwork around Microsoft Teams and make the best use of this application, on one hand it is essential to promote the adoption by all the different departments in your company. On the other hand, it is important to establish a defined framework to avoid the profusion of groups, sometimes in duplicate, resulting in a loss of efficiency and overinformation. This will inevitably put a break on adoption...Then, how can you get Microsoft Teams customized and adapted to your company's departments? How do you create team templates that meet your needs?How to help get familiar with teams created for users? How to ensure that teams are clearly organized? How to ensure satisfactory governance both for the businesses and the IT departments of the company? With SalesTim, you can create a catalog of Business Solutions in Microsoft Teams using team templates with their own levels of governance. Team templates include the list of channels, tabs, and pre-configured site and planner tabs. Simply create team templates that meet your needs: project management, response to a call for bids, recruitment management... The possibilities are endless and customizable! Set up a level of governance adapted to each of your templates and according to your needs: naming convention, an owner, permanent members... And much more! Everything is in your hands!To understand how the solution works, we will first experience it from the end-user's perspective, then from the administrator's point of view. To do this, we are now in the shoes of a Contoso project manager.SalesTim is an application in Microsoft Teams.In the homepage, I find all the teams of which I am a member.I can easily find a team thanks to the research tool.I want to create a new team to launch my project. I click on ""New team""and access the catalog of business solutions, which has been made available by the company.I then have the opportunity to create a team dedicated to the sales Department,to the HR Department or the management of new project. So, I choose this business solution.I enter the name of my project: Paris.A naming convention appears directly because the name of the team will be ""Paris - New Center"".I then make the request.Once the team is created the channels and information pushed by the company appear.For example, it could be a planner with a list of tasks already integrated.As a project manager all I have to do is assign them.You have seen how easy it is to have a created team ready to use and adapted to a specific business. We will see how to add a new business solution to the company's catalog. As an Office 365 administrator, I go to SalesTim in the catalog part and I create a new business solution.To do this, I select an existing team that will serve as a template.

OneDrive & Office Lens – Complete your expense form in 2 min!,"- Hi! You look terrified, what's going on? - Yes, I have a problem. The accountant is chasing me...- Oh, I see... but... don't you think she's pretty?- No, no, it's not what you think! She is after me because it's the end of the month and I still haven't sent her my expense form. It's always so complicated, I have to scan all my documents, send them to her, fill in an Excel sheet. I don't have time for that!Well, I guess you don't know about Office Lens! Let me show you how it works.Office Lens is a free application that you can link to your OneDrive account. I use it for my expense form. Forget about photocopiers and scanners.Once the application is downloaded and installed, I just take a picture of my tickets and receipts.Right, but centering a document is quite hard. Believe me, I already tried.Not so fast! With Lens there's no need to bother centering. The application does it on its own and look, I can even photograph several documents in a row.I will be able to collect all my receipts in a single PDF file.I will then save it in a OneDrive folder.So from OneDrive, I share this file with the accountant.She can, on her side, open the PDF and retrieve all the information she needs.In addition, Lens will automatically transcribe the text content of the photos, which allows it to copy and paste without risk of error.- Oh... I see! Anyway, do you get along well with the accountant?- She absolutely loves me!",hi look terrifi what go ye problem account chase oh see dont think she pretti think end month still havent sent expens form alway complic scan document send fill excel sheet dont time thatwel guess dont know offic len let show worksoffic len free applic link onedr account use expens form forget photocopi scannersonc applic download instal take pictur ticket receiptsright center document quit hard believ alreadi triednot fast len there need bother center applic look even photograph sever document rowi abl collect receipt singl pdf filei save onedr folderso onedr share file accountantsh side open pdf retriev inform needsin addit len automat transcrib text content photo allow copi past without risk error oh see anyway get along well account absolut love

When and why use live events?,"We will see in this introduction.When and why use live events.To answer this question,we need to understand the differenceis based on a conventional meeting.There are four major differences betweentraditional meetings and live events.The first difference is the type of exchange.A traditional meeting is used to collaborate.The mode of exchange isdirect and collaborative.Whereas in live event weare only in Decending Mode.Participants cannot communicatedirectly with the presenters,only the Q&A module can be usedif the organizer has activated it.The second difference is thetype of connection.In a typical meeting,participants must log in.And therefore are authenticated.You cannot participate anonymously ina traditional teams meeting and likethe live event where you can haveidentified participants in anonymous ones,especially under the public event mode,as in this case the connection isdone via link for participants.It is also easy to connect via this link.The third difference is the numberof participants for classic meeting,the limit is 250 participants.Which is already interesting.For a live event,that number can reach up to 10,000participants, which is 40 times more.Finally.In terms of organizing a live event,there are different rules,such as presenter, organizer, producer.The organization can be more complex,especially if you are several to present.In a typical meeting,everyone can present content ofthe organizer invites you.There is not really a specific role.The difference is also technical.A live event is a slightly delayedlive event, such as a streaming video.This gives the listener the opportunityto pause during the broadcast orto rewind as on a video player.In general,the recording of the event willbe available for replay as soonas the event is over.So to conclude,use live events when youwant to give information,chop down for a large number of participants,and if you want to give accessto a replay of the event,I invite you to view the othervideos for more details on settingup and managing a live event.",see introductionwhen use live eventsto answer questionw need understand differencei base convent meetingther four major differ betweentradit meet live eventsth first differ type exchangea tradit meet use collaborateth mode exchang isdirect collaborativewherea live event wear decend modeparticip communicatedirectli presentersonli qa modul usedif organ activ itth second differ thetyp connectionin typic meetingparticip must log inand therefor authenticatedy particip anonym ina tradit team meet liketh live event haveidentifi particip anonym onesespeci public event modea case connect isdon via link participantsit also easi connect via linkth third differ numberof particip classic meetingth limit 250 participantswhich alreadi interestingfor live eventthat number reach 10000particip 40 time morefinallyin term organ live eventther differ rulessuch present organ producerth organ complexespeci sever presentin typic meetingeveryon present content ofth organ invit youther realli specif roleth differ also technicala live event slightli delayedl event stream videothi give listen opportunityto paus broadcast orto rewind video playerin generalth record event willb avail replay soona event overso concludeus live event youwant give informationchop larg number participantsand want give accessto replay eventi invit view othervideo detail settingup manag live event

Creating a permission group,"A share point group is a set ofusers who have the same set ofpermissions to the site and content.Rather than assigning permissionsto one person at a time,we will be able to use groups too easily.Assign the same level ofpermission to multiple people.On your website or team site.We will click on settings,the small star wheel at the top rightand then we will select site settings.Under the users and permissionstab I select site permissions.The permissions page appears.I find my existing groupsand from the ribbon.Under the permissions tab thereis a button to create a new group.I will of course named this group,for example providers.I can also add a description.By the same token,I am going to choose an owner for the group.The owner will have theright to remove the group,change the permissions and many other things.Be aware that there canonly be 1 owner for group.I will then designate whether individualscan view the membership list.And further, if they can add orremove members of the group.As shown here,who can view the membership of the group?I can choose members ofthe group or everyone.In that case,everyone in the company,even if they are not members of the group,will be able to see the listof members of that group.Who can edit the membership of the group?Can only the owner changethe membership of the group,or can all members of the groupdo so as well?Then you will define the rulefor membership requests.Do users need to make a membership requestor a dropout request to leave a group?You can choose yes or no.If they must apply to join a group,you will have to choose whether you wantto automatically accept these requests.If you choose no.Be aware that this request will besent by email to the address youwill be providing in the next field.Generally,this address is the addressof the owner of the group.Although I can put someone else,it is quite possible.So in this case, if I enter my address,I will receive a notification.I would be able to accept or refusethe application for membership.Finally,it is extremely important I choose alevel of permission for this group.Please note that permissionlevels are created by default.But there is another tutorial that showshow to create custom permission levels.In my example,my suppliers need to collaborate,view and edit documents easily.So I am going to choosethe edit permission level.I validate by pressing the create button.And then I can use my permissiongroup after this.

Creating a personalized permission level,"If you are the SharePoint administratoror site collection manager, you probablywant to control who can edit your side.For example, you want to allowfinancial service staff to edit lists.While the marketing Departmentshould only be able to view them.To do this you will use permissions.Permissions allow share pointusers to perform certain actions.For example, changing items in alist or creating a site, however.You cannot assign individualpermissions to users in SharePoint.On the other hand,you can Group D associatedpermissions under a permission level,which is then assigned to agroup of SharePoint permissions,including the people youassign permissions to.Share point includes defaultpermission levels that you can use,for instance con tribute or read.If none of them meet your needs,you can create new ones.To create or change permission levels,you need to belong to a SharePointgroup authorized to manage permissions.You can do this by default if you dobelong to the owners group or if youare a site collection administrator.In the top level site in the site collection,click on the kog wheel to access thesettings. Then select site settings.On the site settings page,in the users and permissions section,select site permissions.In the permissions tab.In the manage group,click permissions levels.On the permissions levels page,select add a permission level.We will then add a name.And a description.Finally, in the permissions area.Activate all checkboxes correspondingto personal list and site permissions.Which you want to include in thispermission level.

Secure your teams in Microsoft TEAMS as you create them,"One essential thing to understand whencreating a new team in Microsoft Teams isthat it automatically involves creatinga SharePoint team site connected to it.It is in this SharePoint sitethat older documents to sharewithin your team will be stored.At the time of the creation of the team,whether public or private,the initial choice does have an impacton the level of protection of theinformation and documents you wishto share with your coworkers in it.When you create a public team,everyone in your organization can join it.However, if you choose to createa private team.The level of security is higher.In fact, you get to decide who is partof the team and all employees who wishto join this team have to make a request.In both cases it is the rules set byyour company for Team SharePoint sitesthere are applied to document sharing.If your organization allows it,your team members will be able to sharedocuments in the teams SharePoint sitewith internal or external colleagues.Even if they are not part of the team.As the team owner you will not havevisibility on employees who shareddocuments with people outside the team.Indeed, if you can view the members,an guests of the documentat anytime in the settings.You will have to go into the optionsfor sharing each document or folderto check if it has been shared withpeople outside the team. However.You can set up the SharePoint siteunderlying your team in teams to preventthe sharing of documents by team members.Start by creating a newprivate team in teams.Then open the linked SharePoint site.And go to the sites permissions.Then go to members sharing arrangements.By default,owners and members can share the site.As well as its documents and files.People with editing permissions canshare files and folders on the site.You can restrict its access by allowing onlyowners to share the entire SharePoint site.However, to maintain as much control aspossible over sharing your documents,choose to allow.Only site owners can share.This way your team members will onlybe able to share with people whoalready have access to the document,meaning team members.Or specific people.But you will need to approve thissharing request as the team owner.If you want to further restrictaccess to your teams documents,you can also disable access requests.This will prevent other employeesfrom requesting access toyour team and his documents.Your team members will alsono longer be able to sharedocuments with specific people.And will be restricted tosharing only with team members.",one essenti thing understand whencreat new team microsoft team isthat automat involv creatinga sharepoint team site connect itit sharepoint sitethat older document sharewithin team storedat time creation teamwheth public privateth initi choic impacton level protect theinform document wishto share cowork itwhen creat public teameveryon organ join ithowev choos createa privat teamth level secur higherin fact get decid partof team employe wishto join team make requestin case rule set byyour compani team sharepoint sitesther appli document sharingif organ allow ityour team member abl sharedocu team sharepoint sitewith intern extern colleagueseven part teama team owner havevis employe shareddocu peopl outsid teaminde view membersan guest documentat anytim settingsy go optionsfor share document folderto check share withpeopl outsid team howevery set sharepoint siteunderli team team preventth share document team membersstart creat newpriv team teamsthen open link sharepoint siteand go site permissionsthen go member share arrangementsbi defaultown member share sitea well document filespeopl edit permiss canshar file folder sitey restrict access allow onlyown share entir sharepoint sitehowev maintain much control asposs share documentschoos allowonli site owner sharethi way team member onlyb abl share peopl whoalreadi access documentmean team membersor specif peoplebut need approv thisshar request team ownerif want restrictaccess team documentsy also disabl access requeststhi prevent employeesfrom request access toyour team documentsyour team member alsono longer abl sharedocu specif peopleand restrict toshar team member
